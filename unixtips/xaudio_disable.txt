If you are getting lots of error messages in your syslog that look like:

inetd[140]: /usr/openwin/bin/Xaserver: Hangup
last message repeated 2623 times
inetd[140]: /usr/openwin/bin/Xaserver: Hangup
last message repeated 2497 times

Just go into /etc/inet/inetd.conf
and comment out the line about xaudio/Xaserver.

Then, of course, you need to hup the inetd process to have the change take affect.
