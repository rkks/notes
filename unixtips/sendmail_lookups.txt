Q.  How can I easily determine where an e-mail will go if sent to such-and-such an address?

A. 

Easy way
--------
/usr/lib/sendmail -bv e-mail_addr_to_consult

For instance:
/usr/lib/sendmail -bv amanda
will tell you where the amanda e-mail will go and which relay it will need to 
travel through to get there.


More involved method
--------------------
/usr/lib/sendmail -bt -d38.25
then type:
/map aliases e-mail_addr_to_consult

You should see the answer toward the bottom in all the detailed output that appears.
when done, type:
<ctrl>-d
to exit.
