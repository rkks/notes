<P>
The intent of this document is to describe Soft Partitioning within
Solstice DiskSuite (soon-to-be-renamed Solaris Volume Manager), and
offer a short primer/tutorial on how to create, use, and delete them.

<P>
Until now, Solaris, without any volume management software, has only
ever allowed a fixed number of partitions on a physical disk (seven (7)
on SPARC platforms).  With the increase in capacity of disks, this
limitation has become a severe restriction.

<P>
SDS/SVM uses these slices for its metadevices (sub-mirrors, trans,
stripes, and RAID5) and hence is faced with the same limitation,
whereas Veritas Volume Manager (VxVM) allows for the logical
partitioning of disks into a <I>virtually</I> unlimited number of
subdisks.

<P>
Soft Partitioning allows for a disk to be subdivided into many
partitions which are controlled and maintained by software, thereby
removing the limitation of the number of partitions on a disk. A soft
partition is made up of one or more "<I>extents</I>".  An extent
describes the parts of the physical disk that make up the soft
partition.  While the maximum number of extents per soft partition is
2147483647, the majority of soft partitions will use only one (1)
extent.


<BR><P><HR><H2>What is new?</H2>

<P>
Soft Partitioning was <B>not</B> in the original Solstice DiskSuite
4.2.1 Release, which coincided with the release of Solaris 8.  However,
the soft partitioning functionality was released in patch 108693-06 for
SDS 4.2.1.

<P>
When Solaris 9 gets released, the "Solstice DiskSuite" name will change
to "Solaris Volume Manager" ("SVM") and it will be bundled in with
Solaris 9.  Soft Partitioning will, of course, be part of the base
functionality of that release.

<P>
Soft Partitions are implemented by new kernel driver: <B>md_sp</B>.

<PRE>
   #<B> modinfo | grep md_sp</B>
   228 78328000 4743 - 1 md_sp (Meta disk soft partition module)
</PRE>

There are new options to the <I>metainit</I> command:
<PRE>
   <B>metainit</B> <I>softpart</I> <B>-p [-e]</B> <I>component size</I>
   <B>metainit</B> <I>softpart</I> <B>-p</B> <I>component</I> <B>-o</B> <I>offset</I> <B>-b</B> <I>size</I>
</PRE>

The <I>metattach</I> command has been modified to allow for growing of
soft partitions:
<PRE>
   <B>metattach</B> <I>softpart size</I>
</PRE>

There is a new command... <I>metarecover</I>:
<PRE>
   <B>metarecover [-n] [-v]</B> <I>component</I> <B>-p [-d|-m]</B>
</PRE>

<P><B>NOTE</B>: the <B>-p</B> option means that the command refers to
soft partitions.


<BR><P><HR><H2>Creating Soft Partitions</H2>

There are three methods to create a soft partition using the
<I>metainit</I> command:

<OL>
<P><LI>Specifying an unused disk and size (with the <B>-e</B> option).
For example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d0 -p -e c1t0d0 200m</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
The <B>-e</B> option requires that the name of the disk supplied be in
the form <B>c#t#d#</B>.

<P>
The last parameter (200m) specifies the initial size of the soft
partition. The sizes can be specified in blocks, kilobytes, megabytes,
gigabytes, and terabytes.

<P>
The <B>-e</B> option causes the disk to be repartitioned such that
slice 7 has enough space to hold a replica (although no replica is
actually created on this disk) and slice 0 contains the rest of the
space.  Slice 2 is removed from the disk.  The soft partition that is
being created is put into slice 0.  Further soft partitions can be
created on slice 0 by the next method of creating a soft partition.

<P>
After this command is run, the layout of the disk would like
similar to this example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   Part      Tag   Flag   Cylinders     Size           Blocks
     0 unassigned   wm     5 - 2035   999.63MB   (2031/0/0) 2047248
     1 unassigned   wm     0            0        (0/0/0)          0
     2 unassigned   wm     0            0        (0/0/0)          0
     3 unassigned   wm     0            0        (0/0/0)          0
     4 unassigned   wm     0            0        (0/0/0)          0
     5 unassigned   wm     0            0        (0/0/0)          0
     6 unassigned   wm     0            0        (0/0/0)          0
     7 unassigned   wu     0 -   4      2.46MB   (5/0/0)       5040
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
This command (with the <B>-e</B>) can only be run on an empty disk (one
that is not used in any other metadevice).  If another metadevice or
replica already exists on this disk, one of the following messages will
be printed, and no soft partition will be created.

<PRE>
   metainit: hostname: c#t#d#s0: has appeared more than once in the specification of d#
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
   metainit: hostname: c#t#d#s#: has a metadevice database replica
</PRE>

<P><LI>
Specifying an existing slice name and size (without the <B>-e</B>
option).  This will be the most common method of creation.  For
example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
    #<B> metainit d1 -p c1t0d0s0 1g</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a soft partition on the specified slice.  No
repartitioning of the disk is done.  Provided there is space on the
slice, additional soft partitions could be created as required.  The
device name must include the slice number (c#t#d#s#).

<P>
If another soft partition already exists in this slice, this one will
be created immediately after the existing one.  Therefore, no overlap
of soft partitions can occur by accident.

<P><LI>
Specifying an existing slice and absolute offset and size values.
For example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d2 -p c1t0d0s0 -o 2048 -b 1024</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

The <B>-o</B> parameter signifies the offset into the slice, and the
<B>-b</B> parameter is the size for the soft partition.
All numbers are in blocks (a block is 512 bytes).

The <I>metainit</I> command ensures that extents and soft
partitions do not overlap.  For example, the following is an attempt
to create overlapping soft partitions.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d1 -p c1t0d0s0 -o 1 -b 2024</B>
   d1: Soft Partition is setup
   #<B> metainit d2 -p c1t0d0s0 -o 2000 -b 2024</B>
   metainit: hostname: d2: overlapping extents specified
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
An offset of <B>0</B> is not valid, as the first block on a slice
containing a soft partition contains the initial extent header.
Each extent header consumes 1 block of disk and each soft
partition will have an extent header placed at the end of each extent.
Extent headers are explained in more detail in the next section.

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> This method is not documented in the man page for
<I>metainit</I> and is not recommended for manual use.  It is here
because a subsequent <B>metastat -p</B> command will output information
in this format.
</OL>

<BR><P><HR><H2>Extent Headers</H2>

<P>
Whenever a soft partiton is created in a disk slice, an "extent header"
is written to disk.  Internally to Sun, these are sometimes referred to
as "watermarks".

<P>
An extent header is a consistency record and contains such information
as the metadevice (soft partition) name, it's status, it's size, and a
checksum.  Each extent header 1 block (512 bytes) in size.

<P>
The following diagram shows an example 100MB slice (c1t0d0s0) and the
extent headers (watermarks) that have been created on it.  The command
to make the soft partition shown was

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d1 -p c1t0d0s0 20m</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<!--
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="softpart-diag1.jpg">
</CENTER>
->>

<P>
There is always an extent header on the first and last blocks in the slice.
Note that the 80MB of space left over from the creation of the soft
partition can be used to make one or more additional soft partitions.
Each additional soft partition will create an additional extent header to
be created as well.

</OL>

<BR><P><HR><H2>Mirroring Soft Partitions</H2>

Once you have created soft partitions, what can you do with them?
Well, one thing to do is to create mirrors out of them.  Unfortunately,
even though a soft partition is a metadevice, they cannot serve
directly as a submirror.  For example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d10 -p c1t11d0s4 100m</B>
   d10: Soft Partition is setup
   #<B> metainit d20 -m d10</B>
   metainit: hostname: d10: invalid unit
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

Instead, you must first take the soft partition and create a
simple concat/stripe out of it.  For example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d10 -p c1t0d0s0 100m</B>
   d10: Soft Partition is setup
   #<B> metainit d20 1 1 d10</B>
   d20: Concat/Stripe is setup
   #<B> metainit d30 -m d20</B>
   d30: Mirror is setup

   #<B> metainit d11 -p c2t0d0s0 100m</B>
   d11: Soft Partition is setup
   #<B> metainit d21 1 1 d11</B>
   d21: Concat/Stripe is setup
   #<B> metattach d30 d21</B>
   d30: submirror d21 is attached
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
Once done, the resulting <I>metastat</I> output of the mirror
will look like this:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>

<BR><P><HR><H2>Layering</H2>

<P>
Most of the time, soft partitions are made on a disk slice.  However,
there are certain situations where it can be beneficial to make a soft
partition on <I>top</I> of an existing metadevice.  This is referred to
as <B>layering</B>.

<P>
For example, say you have a 90GB RAID5 device made up of 6 18GB disks.
You can then take that 90GB device and "split it up" into many soft
partitions.  These many soft partitions then can be accessed as
separate simple metadevices, although the data in them is protected by
the RAID5 parity in the underlying device.

<P>
Soft partitions can be layered <I>only</I> on top of concat/stripes,
mirrors, and RAID5 devices. Soft partitions cannot be layered on top of
a metatrans device or directly on top of another soft partition.

<P>
Here is an example of layering soft partitions on top of an existing
RAID5 metadevice.  First, we create the RAID5 device, then
soft partition that device into 3 100MB partitions (obviously, we
could create <I>more</I> than just 3 soft partitions).

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d0 -r c1t0d2s0 c1t0d4s0 c1t1d1s0 c1t1d3s0</B>
   d0: RAID is setup

   #<B> metainit d1 -p d0 100m</B>
   d1: Soft Partition is setup
   #<B> metainit d2 -p d0 100m</B>
   d2: Soft Partition is setup
   #<B> metainit d3 -p d0 100m</B>
   d3: Soft Partition is setup
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
Each of the resulting soft partitions (<B>d1</B>, <B>d2</B>, and
<B>d3</B>) can be accessed individually (i.e., <I>newfs</I> and
<I>mount</I>).

<P>
Soft partitions can be built on top of an existing mirror device as
well, just like we did above on the RAID5 device.  In the following
example, the mirror device (<B>d0</B>) is "carved up" into 3 smaller
soft partitions.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>

   #<B> metainit d3 -p d0 100m</B>
   d3: Soft Partition is setup
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
Soft partitions are not allowed to be parented by other soft partitions
directly.  For example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>

   #<B> metainit d2 -p d1 10m</B>
   metainit: hostname: d1: invalid unit
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

Soft partitions also cannot be built on top of trans (UFS logging)
devices.  For example:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d1 -t d10 d20</B>

<P>
A soft partition can be grown by the use of the <I>metattach</I>
command.  There is no mechanism to shrink a soft partition.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metattach d0 10m</B>
   d0: Soft Partition has been grown
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
When additional space is added to an existing soft partition,
the additional space is taken from any available space on the same
device and might not be contiguous with the existing soft partition.
Growing soft partitions must be done with free space in the same
device as the current soft partition.

<P>
The following example shows how growing a soft partition will increase
the size of the current extent:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d1 -p c1t0d2s0 100m</B>

                0                        1                   204800

   #<B> metattach d1 50m</B>

   #<B> metastat d1</B>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
Note how after the <I>metattach</I> is run, there is still only one
extent, but the (block count) has grown from 204800 (100MB) to
307200 (150MB).

<P>
In the following example, the extent cannot be grown, as it was above,
because another soft partition is "in the way".  Therefore, a second
extent is created in the same slice.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
Note how <B>d1</B> now has two non-contiguous extents that
together make up the 307200 (150MB) blocks.

<P>
<B>NOTE</B>: Growing the metadevice does not modify the data or the
filesystem inside the metadevice.  If the metadevice contains a
filesystem, you must use the appropriate command(s) to grow that
filesystem after the metadevice has been grown.

<BR><P><HR><H2>Deleting Soft Partitions</H2>

This is achieved by using the <I>metaclear</I> command in the normal way:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metaclear d0</B>
   d0: Soft Partition is cleared
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

If other metadevices are using the soft partition, the <I>metaclear</I>
will error with:

<PRE>
   metaclear: hostname: d0: metadevice in use
</PRE>


<BR><P><HR><H2>Using Soft Partitions with Disksets</H2>

<P>
There are no differences with soft partitioning in a diskset, other
than having to specify the <B>-s</B> option on the commandline to
specify the diskset name.

<P>
The only potential problem occurs when dealing with <B>did</B> disk
devices that are in a SunCluster configuration.  Unfortunately, the
naming convention of the <B>did</B> devices is similar to that of
SDS/SVM in that the disks are referred to as <B>d</B>#.  This
means that SDS/SVM could confuse a <B>did</B> disk with a metadevice
when creating a soft partition.

<P>
The simple workaround to this problem is to use the full path to the
<B>did</B> device on the <I>metainint</I> commandline in order to
prevent any confusion.

<P>
For example, the following command to create a 1GB soft partition on
<B>/dev/did/rdsk/d7s0</B> would be invalid:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit -s set2 d0 -p d7s0 1g</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

Instead, the correct command to run would be:

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit -s set2 d0 -p /dev/did/rdsk/d7s0 1g</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>


<BR><P><HR><H2>How to list the soft partitions in a given slice</H2>

<P>
The <I>metarecover</I> command, with the <B>-n</B> and <B>-v</B>
options, will display information about the soft partitons existing in
a given slice.

<P>
The <I>metarecover</I> command actually scans the given slice for
extent headers and prints the information that it finds about those
headers.

<P>
In each slice/device, there are also 2 additional extent headers; one
which preceeds the free space in the slice, and the one on the last
block of the slice.  These are printed as well.  This is an easy way to
determine how much free space is available in a slice for
additional soft partitions.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metarecover -v -n /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0s0 -p</B>

   Found 2 soft partition(s) on c1t0d0s0.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
In the above example, there were 2 soft partitions (d0 and
d1) found on c1t0d0s0, as well as 17613458 blocks (approx 8.4GB)
of unallocated free space.

<P>
<B>IMPORTANT NOTE:</B> The information printed by this command is
relative to the extent header, not the soft partition itself.
Therefore, the 'offset' is the starting location of the extent header,
not the extent itself.  Also, the 'length' given is the length of the
extent plus the header.  Therefore, in the example above, there are
only 17613458 free blocks, not 17613459 blocks.

<P>
Because soft partitions can be layered above metadevices like mirrors
or RAID5 devices (see <I>layering</I>, above), this command can also be
run on them to determine the locations and sizes of the extent
headers.  In the example below, <B>d0</B> is a RAID5 metadevice which
has 4 soft partitions in it.  There is no free space left in this
device.

</PRE>


<BR><P><HR><H2>Fragmentation</H2>

<P>
Fragmentation of free space will occur on a slice when there has been
activity in creating, deleting, and possibly growing soft partitions.
At this time, there is no method to defragment a disk.

<P>
For example, the following sequence of commands can result in some
amount of fragmentation.  First, create 2 10MB soft partitions on a slice.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metainit d1 -p c1t0d0s0 10m</B>
   d1: Soft Partition is setup
   #<B> metainit d2 -p c1t0d0s0 10m</B>
   d2: Soft Partition is setup
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

<P>
Then, remove the first 10MB soft partition and then create a 20MB soft
partition.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metaclear d1</B>
   d1: Soft Partition is cleared
   #<B> metainit d3 -p c1t0d0s0 20m</B>
   d3: Soft Partition is setup
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

When the <B>d3</B> metadevice was created, the 10MB of free space at
the beginning of the slice is not used, because there is a contiguous
20MB space available further out that can be used instead.  Therefore,
the 10MB of free space is skipped over in favor of the first 20MB of
contiguous space.  The <I>metarecover</I> command will show the
fragmentation (multiple free spaces):

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   #<B> metarecover -v -n c1t0d0s0 -p</B>

<BR><P><HR><H2>Recovering Soft Partitions</H2>

The 'metarecover' command is run when something has gone wrong.  It should
not be run except to recover from a catastrophic problem.

There are two main functions that this command does.  It can
<P><OL>
<LI>
scan through the given slice and recreate the soft partitions
that it finds there.  this is good when moving a disk with soft
partitions to a new machine.  The option to use on the metarecover
command is <B>-d</B>.
<P><LI>
reads through the current replica and creates the soft partitions
on the given slice.  This is good to run after a disk fails and
gets replaced with a new one.  The option to use on the metarecover
command is <B>-m</B>.
</OL>

<H3>Recreating Information in the Replica from the Extent Headers</H3>

Here is a very simple example showing a disk which had soft partitions
created on it (in slice 0) on another host, which is being moved to a
new machine.  We wish to extract the soft partitions on this new
machine.

Currently, there are no metadevices created.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   # <B>metastat</B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

This command scans the given slice (in this case, "c0t0d0s0") and, for
each soft partition it finds in that slice, it puts an entry into the
current replica.

The data on the disk is not modified, and nothing on the slice
specified is modified.  All that happens is that the extent headers are
read and information is written to the replica.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   # <B>metarecover c0t0d0s0 -p -d</B>
   The following soft partitions were found and will be added to

Now, we can see the soft partition metadevices have been created for us:

<H3>Recreating Soft Partitions from Information in the Replica</H3>

This example essentially does the opposite of example 1.

In this case, the actual extent headers on the disk have been lost,
either because something wrote over them, or because the disk
hosting the soft partitions had to be replaced with new disk drive.

Although the replica shows the soft partitions to be "Okay":

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   # <B>metastat</B>
   d1: Soft Partition

</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

there are no extent headers on the disk, so I/O to the disk will error
out.

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   # <B>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/md/rdsk/d2</B>
   dd: /dev/md/rdsk/d2: open: I/O error
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

To check the disk to see if any extent headers exist on the disk,
you can run the command

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   # <B>metarecover -n c0t0d0s0 -p</B>
   found incorrect magic number 0, expected 20000127.
   No extent headers found on c0t0d0s0.
   c0t0d0s0: On-disk structures invalid or no soft partitions found.
   metarecover: hostname: d0: bad magic number in extent header
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

The above command confirms that there are no extent headers on the disk.

To have the extent headers written out to the disk, according to the
information currently in the replica, run the command

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
<PRE>
   # <B>metarecover c0t0d0s0 -p -m</B>
   c0t0d0s0: Soft Partition metadb configuration is valid

   WARNING: You are about to overwrite portions of c0t0d0s0
   with soft partition metadata. The extent headers will be
   written to match the existing metadb configuration.  If
   the device was not previously setup with this
   configuration, data loss may result.

   Are you sure you want to do this (yes/no)? <B>yes</B>

   c0t0d0s0: Soft Partitions recovered from metadb
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</PRE>

Now, the extent headers have been written to the disk, so I/O
will work correctly now.  Running the verify command again, we
see

<P><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 width=75%><TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TD>
