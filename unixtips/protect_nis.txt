Protecting the NIS Maps Directory


The /var/yp directory should only be accessible by root. Change the
permissions accordingly. If you are running TripWire, COPS or any
other security tool, you should make it a part of the security audit
process.

Setup /var/yp/securenets

You should configure NIS to make its maps available only to certain
networks. This can be done with the /var/yp/securenets file, here is
an example:

255.255.255.0 10.10.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.21.0

To restrict availability to hosts, simply add the IP address of that
host(s):

255.255.255.0 10.10.20.2 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1

Secure your Root account

The root account should always be local! You should never allow it to
be a part of NIS. If a hacker discovered the root password, he/she
would have access to all of the machines within the NIS domain. Also,
if NIS ever failed, you may not be able to login as root on any
machine in the domain.

Move NIS Maps

NIS uses the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/inetd/netmasks files by
default for its maps. Two problems with this are; anyone with login
access to the system will be able to read all of the NIS maps;
second, with /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow as NIS map sources, root
login will be possible only if NIS is running properly. You should
move these files out of the /etc directory.
