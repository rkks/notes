How to recreate /dev/null and how did I get here?


If you tried to move a file to /dev/null as root, that will do it.  :)





To just recreate the soft link "/dev/null"
------------------------------------------
as root, type: devlinks



If you have messed up the original device in /devices/....
----------------------------------------------------------
mknod /devices/pseudo/mm@0:null c 13 2
chown root:sys /devices/pseudo/mm@0:null
chmod 666 /devices/pseudo/mm@0:null
cd /dev
ln -s ../devices/pseudo/mm@0:null null
