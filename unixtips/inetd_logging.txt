Q.  How can I setup the server so we log all telnet and ftp connections?

A.  Since these are run from inetd, you need to add the '-t' switch to inetd startup.

In the file:
	/etc/init.d/inetsvc

Change:
	/usr/sbin/inetd -s &
to:
	/usr/sbin/inetd -s -t &


From the man page:

     -t    Instructs inetd to trace the incoming connections  for
           all  of its TCP services.  It does this by logging the
           client's IP address and TCP port  number,  along  with
           the  name  of the service, using the syslog(3C) facil-
           ity. UDP services can not be traced. When  tracing  is
           enabled,  inetd  uses  the syslog facility code 
	   ``daemon'' and ``notice'' priority level
