Quad Fast Ethernet Trunking Software Setup

NOTE:  There is a manual that came with this.  This is only a summary.
	This DOES NOT "come with" the QFE card.  It is software that was purchased from Sun.

Edit the file: /etc/opt/SUNWqfetr/bin/qfetr.sh


An explanation of the settings you can use are included in the file below

echo Configuring QFE trunking devices
#
# Please check your /etc/path_to_inst file to select an instance # to
# be used as trunk head and this instance # must belong to a 4-port
# qfe card.
#
#   Example: /etc/path_to_inst
#
#    "/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,qfe@3,8c30000" 3 "qfe"
#    "/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,qfe@3,8c20000" 2 "qfe"
#    "/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,qfe@3,8c10000" 1 "qfe"
#    "/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,qfe@3,8c00000" 0 "qfe"
#
# Edit this file by adding qfetr(1M) commands that will set up
# the trunk head, the number of links per trunk and the trunk policy.
#
# After modifying this file qfetr.sh, you must create
# /etc/hostname.qfe entry(N is the instance #) for this trunk head and
# reboot your system.
#
#	qfetr -setup head-instance [ links=<2|4> ] [ policy=<1..32> ]
#                                  [ members=<instance,instance,.,.> ]
#
# 
# If you want to change the trunk configuration once a trunk is configured,
# you need to modify this file qfetr.sh and reboot the system.
#
# The following examples configure two trunks:
#
# The first qfetr command uses qfe instance #0 as trunk head, 
# 4 links (default is 4) for this trunk and the default trunk policy is 1
# which # is mac.
#
#qfetr -setup 0
#	or
#qfetr -setup 0 links=4 policy=1
#
# The second qfetr command uses qfe instance #4 as trunk head, 
# 2 links for this trunk, the trunk policy is 2 which is round robin
# and trunk members are 4 and 5 Trunk members are instance numbers
# recorded in /etc/path_to_inst file.
#
#qfetr -setup 4 links=2 policy=2 members=4,5

# Add Sun Trunking Configuration entries below.
#
# Details
#--------
# setup - trunk head, pick one of the instances
# links - how many links will be in this config:
#       4 - one 400mb virtual connection
#       2 - two separate trunks ( two 200mb connections)
# policy - MAC or roundrobin
#       1 - MAC
#       2 - roundrobin
# members - the instance numbers that belong to this trunk

qfetr -setup 0 links=2 policy=1 members=0,1

# end of script
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The card is laid out as follows:
	Port	Member #
	 1	  0
	 2	  1
	 3	  2
	 4	  3

So then you need to add the /etc/hostname.qfex for the config you have chosen.
If you have one 200Mb connection and 2-100Mb connections, you will have
	hostname.qfe0, hostname.qfe2, hostname.qfe3

You probably want to go to the boot prompt and set
	local-mac-address?=true
just incase you connect the server up twice to the same subnet with different IP's, each of them will have a different MAC.

You may also want to 
	touch /etc/notrouter
to keep the server from routing between the interfaces.
