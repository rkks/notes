Q. How can I create an account that doesn't allow FTP access, but will allow telnet access?

A. Add an entry for that person's username into the file:
	/etc/ftpusers
   This person will not be able to connect to the box using FTP.



The default entries in this file are usually:
     root
     daemon
     bin
     sys
     adm
     lp
     uccp
     nuucp
     smmsp
     listen
     nobody
     noaccess
     nobody4
