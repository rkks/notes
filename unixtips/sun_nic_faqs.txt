 Q:  Why only 1 card in Ultra 2?
 A:  CPU limitation.  Can't get 500Mhz per card for more than one card.
 
 Q:  Did you say 500 Mhz per card?
 A:  Yes.  This can be in any configuration.  You can have two 250 MHz CPU's,
     three 167's, five 110's, etc.  How you get 500 Mhz is up to you and your
     customer.
     
 Q:  What do you mean "at least a 167 Mhz CPU for trunking"?
 A:  For trunking, all the interrupts that occur are managed by one CPU.  With
     such a heavy load on one CPU, you need to have at least a 167 CPU to handle
     this.  You cannot choose 110 CPU's or 75 CPU's.

 Sun Trunking v1.x has two policies.
 -----------------------------------
 Round-Robin - typically used only for back-to-back Sun server connections.
 MAC-Hashing - typically used only for Trunking-Capable switch connections.

The most efficient algorithm to use is MAC-Hashing, as it maintains
the temporal ordering of packets within a single stream.  It is best
suited to AGGREGATE multiple clients over a Trunked network fabric
as it hashes (binary XOR last 2 bits) client MAC addresses to determine
which port to use.  With a 4-port trunk, 25% of client traffic would
hash (00,01,10,11) to use each of the four 100BaseT QFE ports.
