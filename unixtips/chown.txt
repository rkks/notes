How to allow users to chown files (give the file) to someone else.

 From Sunsolve:

If you want to be able to give away files (ie: chown works as non-root), 
you need to add in the line:
    set rstchown=0
in the /etc/system file.

If you can give away files, but you want to disable this feature, you should put:
    set rstchown=1
in the /etc/system file.

Now reboot your system to implement these changes.
