If you are trying to help someone remotely with a Unix problem and like to
see what that person is actually typing instead of having conversation like
the following:

"Enter ls at the prompt and hit enter"
"Now how does your screen look like?"
"Do you see a the 'x' file in that listing"
...

Try this

- have the person on the other end do 
	telnet localhost | tee -a /tmp/<filename>
- now telnet to the machine yourself and do a 
	tail -f <filename>

Now you can see all the screen dumps including the keystrokes. Off course
this won't work if you can't log on to that machine. But, it still could be
handy.
