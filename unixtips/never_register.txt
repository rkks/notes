To disable the registration reminder after installing Solaris...

	Per user
	--------
	Click on "More information"
	Never Register
	Never Register	
	
	OR
	
	touch ~/.solregis/.disable


	For the entire system
	---------------------
	Add the following line in /etc/default/solregis:
	DISABLE=1


The other alternative is just to remove the packages.  For Solaris 9, these would be:
	system      SUNWerego            Solaris User Registration Installation ID file
	system      SUNWsregu            Solaris User Registration
