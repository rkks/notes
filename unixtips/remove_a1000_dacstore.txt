How to remove the DACstore from an A1000 disk that has been in another A1000 array?

There are a couple of ways, as always, check with Sun for their supported method.

For those that like to live life dangerously, choose one of the following:
a) Go into format, select your disk, choose analyze, then purge 
(now sit back for a VERY LONG TIME.  This should wipe the disk of any 
information (and the DACstore as well).

b) (from http://www.rootprompt.net/a1000.html)
        Run the following on the disk (after removing it from the array and
        placing it in c0t1 on the server, or another server):
                dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2 bs=10240

c) Go into rm6, maintenance, select the raid module, manual recovery, drives
Now select the questionable drive, choose fail, and then revive it.  
This will spin the disk down, mark it as failed, then bring it back to life.  
In the meantime, rm6 has written the DACstore to the drive, overwriting the one it had on it.


Why is this *SO* important?

Since the DACstore (Config info) is located on 3 RANDOM disks in the A1000, 
you need a quorum to keep the A1000 happy (TRUST ME, you don't want it ever
unhappy).  If you go and add some new disks that have a different DACstore 
info on them, the quorum will go kersplat and you have a mess.  


The gist of the story is, if you can help it, DON'T move disks from one A1000 to another.
