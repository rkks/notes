Instead of using /etc/defaultrouter to configure the routing on Sun
machines, you can turn the router discovery protocol (rdisc on Sun) on the
router. 

The Sun machines that don't have /etc/defaultrouter or any other
static routers defined will automatically start the in.rdisc at boot time to
find the router for you (Solaris 8, it should also work for earlier
releases). I believe Cisco routers also support this protocol (could be
wrong on that one).
