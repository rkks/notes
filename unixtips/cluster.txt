This tool will work for Solaris 2.6, 7 & 8. Not sure about versions <2.6. 
To implement and use the Sun Cluster Console tool:

1. Transfer the scripts.jar file to your favorite install dir (I like to use
/var/tmp/download) on your admin server of choice.

2. Extract the jar file:
# jar -xvf scripts.jar
(works just like tar command - see man pages for more info)

3. Install the cluster tool packages:
# cd scripts
# pkgadd -d .
Install both SUNWccon and SUNWscsdb packages. The SUNWccon package installs
the /opt/SUNWcluster directory, while the SUNWscsdb installs the cluster
names database and 'name to serial port' database. These are actually files
called /etc/clusters & /etc/serialports respectively. (You can do a "man
clusters" and "man serialports" after completing step 5).

4. Edit the database files:
a) If you intend to use the telnet/rlogin feature of the cluster console
tool ONLY:
# mv /etc/serialports /etc/serialports.template
# vi /etc/clusters
Add an entry with the hostnames you want to telnet/rlogin to. The
"clustername" in the first field can be any name you want to give it (ie.,
sunhosts). The hostnames must be space delimited.
b) If you intend to use the telnet/rlogin AND console features of the tool:
NOTE: In this scenario you must already have a terminal server installed w/
it's own hostname & IP and the desired hosts connected to the terminal
server. If you have previously renamed the serialports file, rename it back
to it's original filename.
# vi /etc/clusters
Edit the clusters file in same manner as described in step 4(a) above.
# vi /etc/serialports
Add one line for each host. These will be the same hostnames you specified
in the /etc/clusters file. For the 2nd field in the /etc/serialports file,
enter your terminal server hostname- the file identifies it as a 'terminal
concentrator'. The file entry format is <hostname> <terminal concentrator>
<serial_port>. The serial port numbers are somewhat arbitrary, just don't
use a number already in /etc/services or one you know is already in use. I
started at 5001 as the sample entry suggests.

5. Environment variables:
Add /opt/SUNWcluster/bin to your PATH.
Add /opt/SUNWcluster/man to your MANPATH
The binaries are of course in /opt/SUNWcluster/bin.

6. Invoking the sun cluster console tool:
Prerequisites-
- Make sure the above variables are set.
- Make sure your DISPLAY is set to your local host.
- Make sure your local access control is disabled (xhost).
# ctelnet <clustername>
or
# crlogin <clustername>
The cluster console window as well as telnet/rlogin windows for each host
will be displayed. Place your cursor in the cluster console window. Each
command you type will then be SIMULTANEOUSLY displayed in each telnet/rlogin
window. Note: Make sure you keep your cursor in the cluster console window
at ALL times to maintain this functionality.

If your using a terminal server and want a console prompt for each of the
respective hosts:
# cconsole <clustername>

ENJOY! But be very careful. Remember, each command you type is duplicated
"n" times!!
