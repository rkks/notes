		HOW TO MAKE A SPARC BOOTABLE CDROM

SILO may be used to create a bootable CDROM for sparc. At the moment it will
support booting on sun4c, sun4m, sun4d and sun4u machines only, but sun4
support may come soon.

INTRO
=====

A CDROM is booted on Sparc by issuing following commands in the PROM
(depending on PROM version - v0 is PROM with major versions 0, found
on sun4c only, v2 is PROM with major versions 2 or 3, found on some newer
sun4c and all sun4m and sun4d machines) and the same applies to P1275 PROMs
found in the 64bit UltraSparc machines:

v0:

b sd(0,6,0)

v2:

boot cdrom

(cdrom is actually alias to /iommu/sbus/espdma/esp/sd@0,6:d or something
similar)

As Solaris has different kernels for each architecture, the PROM boots by
default from different "partitions" on the CD depending on the architecture
of the machine (that's e.g. the :d in the cdrom alias on v2 PROM). That
partition table is stored in the first 512 bytes of the CD (with exactly the
same format as partition tables on Sparc disks), so you can use SparcLinux
fdisk program to look into that partition table. As SparcLinux at the moment
uses one kernel image for all the architectures and if in the future the
need of different kernel images arises, SILO will have other means of
supporting it, SparcLinux bootable CDROMs have a partition table with only
one partition which covers the whole iso9660 image of the CD. Other
partitions are set up, so that they start at offset 0 (like the first one)
and have size of 0, ie. are disabled. The only value PROM looks at is
starting offset, so that it will boot on all machines correctly.
In the boot process PROM finds start of the boot partition (in SILO case it
is always 0) and loads 7680 bytes from offset 512 in that partition.
Fortunately iso9660 has first 32KB reserved for OS use, so that the
partition table and bootblock can be safely stored there. As SILO is longer
in size than those 32KB (eventhough it is compressed), it puts its first
stage loader in there and puts its second stage loader somewhere in the
iso9660 filesystem.

SILO 0.8.7 and up will no longer create bootable CDs, you should use a
patched mkisofs. A patch for mkisofs is provided in this directory.
With that patch making a SPARC bootable CD is easy, similar to how do you
make El Torito bootable CDs.

STEP BY STEP
============

You should first prepare the tree you'd like to have on the CD. The only
requirement is that you put boot/* files from SILO distribution into /boot
in the tree and edit appropriate /etc/silo.conf in the tree.
As SILO 0.8.7 and up understands the ISO9660 filesystem and the RockRidge
extension, so unlike with older SILOs you should type normal path in
silo.conf. Once the image is prepared, just do

mkisofs -----your-normal-mkisofs-options-here---- -B boot/second.b DIRECTORY_TREE

and you're done.
If you put the first stage and second stage loaders and/or silo.conf file to
nonstandard path, you have to use other options.
E.g. if first stage (boot/cd.b from the SILO package) will be
/images/cdrom.boot on the CD, second stage (boot/second.b) /images/second.stage and
if you put your config file into /config/conf.silo, then you will type

-S images/cdrom.boot -B images/second.stage -s /config/conf.silo

(note when you use starting slash and when you don't).
