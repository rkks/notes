If you are having problems where you have created a .forward file in 
your home directory to forward e-mails from one account (say school)
to another (your work) and it just won't forward them?

First, make sure you typed the e-mail address properly...duh.

Next, make sure the file isn't group or world writable.

Lastly, make sure your home directory isn't group or world writable.



The last one bit me for the longest time.  :(
