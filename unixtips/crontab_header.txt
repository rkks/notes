Many times admins forget the field order of the crontab file 
and alway reference the man pages over-and-over.

Make your life easy. Just put the field definitions in your crontab file 
and comment (#) the lines out so the crontab file ignores it.

# minute (0-59),
# |      hour (0-23),
# |      |       day of the month (1-31),
# |      |       |       month of the year (1-12),
# |      |       |       |       day of the week (0-6 with 0=Sunday).
# |      |       |       |       |       commands
