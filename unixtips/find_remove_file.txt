So you created a file (somehow) with a wierd character in it?  Something like:
	-f
or
	*

Removal Method #1
-----------------
cd to the directory
rm ./funnyfilename

Ex. 
cd /tmp
rm ./-f


Removal Method #2
-----------------
cd to the directory
rm -- -f
If -f was the filename.


Removal Method #3
-----------------
Just cd to the directory and:
	ls -i
to get the inode number.

Plug that into the find statement below:
	find . -inum acutal_inode_number -exec rm -i {} \;





HEY!!  What if I am doing this in the root directory?  I don't want to remove every file with that same inode number on different filesystems.

Just add the -xdev or the -mount option:
	Restricts the search to the file system	containing  
	the directory specified.  Does not list mount 
	points to other file systems.
	
	find . -inum whatever_it_is -mount -exec rm -i {} \;
	
	
	
The -i option will give you a chance to make sure you got it all correct 
(you will be prompted) before going on an rm rampage.
