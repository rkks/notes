It does appear to be undocumented, but it's been around for some time.

The one reference I could find of it was :
-------
This is something new in DiskSuite 4.2.1. The idea is to allow a system
with only 2 disks in a mirror to boot normally if one half of the mirror
is corrupt.

Under DiskSuite 4.1 you always need (1/2*N+1) metastate databases
available for DiskSuite to start (this is the Quorum Rule). Under
DiskSuite 4.2.1 (supported only on Solaris 8) it will start with just
1/2*N databases if you introduce the mirrored_root_flag into
/etc/system. This is not supported on any earlier version though.

I did run across a suggestion from another poster:

*** Remember to set your "boot-device" to point to both disks or this is all for nothing!
