When simply entered at the command prompt, crle reports the current library search path.

Configuration file [3]: /var/ld/ld.config
  Default Library Path (ELF):   /usr/lib:/usr/lib/secure
  Trusted Directories (ELF):    /usr/lib/secure  (system default)

To add /usr/local/lib to this path and update (or create) the config file, the following is entered:
 
crle -c /var/ld/ld.config -l /usr/lib:/usr/lib/secure:/usr/local/lib

Be careful with this, as I'm sure you could completely destroy the library path which will render the system (hopefully temporarily) inoperable.
