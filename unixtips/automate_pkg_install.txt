Q: We are using jumpstart to automate our Solaris installs. At the end,
the jumpstart finish script installs a script that runs after reboot to
install the custom software packages via executing pkgadd commands.
These pkgadd commands in turn have pre- and post-install scripts and
want to interact with the installer. When trying to install, the pkgadd
has errors and fail because the pre- and post-install scripts don't get
that user interaction. Do you know how I could automate this? 

A: You can have pkgadd use an alternate administrative file and do
installs without manual intervention. Your pkgadd command will look
something like the following: 

	pkgadd -n -a $adminfile $package 

$adminfile will be another file in your jumpstart setup that contains
the following text (or you can tailor to taste): 


 mail=
 instance=quit
 partial=nocheck
 runlevel=nocheck
 idepend=nocheck
 rdepend=nocheck
 space=ask
 setuid=nocheck
 conflict=nocheck
 action=nocheck
 basedir=default

This gives the pkgadd command all the answers it needs to do the
installation without intervention, unless you don't have enough space.
The default administration file is located in
/var/sadm/install/admin/default, and specifies ask for most of the above
questions: 


 mail=
 instance=unique
 partial=ask
 runlevel=ask
 idepend=ask
 rdepend=ask
 space=ask
 setuid=ask
 conflict=ask
 action=ask
 basedir=default

See the man page for pkgadd(1M) for more information on the available
flags, and admin(4) for more information on the parameters in the admin file.
