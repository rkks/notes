How to change the banner of the FTP daemon when logging in
----------------------------------------------------------

From the ftpd man page:

The banner returned by in.ftpd in the parenthetical portion
of  its greeting is configurable.  The default is equivalent
to "`uname -sr`" and will be used if no  banner  is  set  in
/etc/default/ftpd.   To  set  the  banner, add a line of the
form

BANNER="..."

to /etc/default/ftpd.  Nonempty banner strings  are  fed  to
shells  for  evaluation.   The  default  banner  may also be
obtained by

BANNER="`uname -s` `uname -r`"

and no banner will be printed if /etc/default/ftpd contains

BANNER=""
