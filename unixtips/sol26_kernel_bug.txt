NOTE:

There is a problem with 105181-33!!! Do not install it if possible.


Do not run boot -r (or touch reconfigure) if you have kernel patch
105181-33 on Solaris 2.6 servers, or all device trees and files can be wiped
out! 


The following must be added to /etc/system to fix this bug:

		set kobj_map_space_len=0x400000
