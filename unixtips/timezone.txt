Problem
-------
How do I change the timezone on my Solaris server/workstation?

Solution
--------
a) Edit /etc/TIMEZONE
	NOTE: the man page incorrectly states this file is called /etc/timezone
b) Reboot your server with shutdown or init.


Examples
--------
US/Eastern
US/Central
US/Mountain
US/Pacific

For the full list, look in:
	/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/
