 Synopsis: DHCP Client has HOSTNAME unknown - /etc/nodename is set
 Description:
A DHCP Client do not become a Hostname from DHCP-Server (Like NT or not set in
Solaris DHCP-Server).

The /etc/nodename was set by the Administrator but it do not work! 
 Work around:



Change in the file /etc/rcS.d/S30network.sh the following:

if [ -z "$hostname" ]; then
        hostname="unknown"
fi


to this:

if [ -z "$hostname" ]; then
        hostname="unknown"
   if [ -f /etc/nodename ]; then
      hostname="`shcat /etc/nodename 2>/dev/null`"
   fi
fi
