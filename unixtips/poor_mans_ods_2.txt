/usr/bin/dd can also be your friend if you don't have a mirroring program
		AND
the disks are the same size.

This will copy everything on a slice, or you can specify the whole disk.
However, unless the disk is nearly full, you may want to break it down per slice
as dd doesn't care if it is copying empty disk or real data.

As a side note, if you want to copy the VTOC and bootblock, do the following:
	dd if=/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s2 of=/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2 count=16


Step 1
------
First you want to choose a slice (/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s1) 
or the entire disk (/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s2).

NOTE: that we are using /dev/rdsk instead of the block device.


Step 2
------
Now select your source and data slices.  

**PLEASE** make sure you get this right.
You can/will overwrite your good data with 0's if you do it wrong.

Source = if (input file)
	/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s2

Destination = of (output file)
	/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2


Step 3
------
Select your bs (block size) for copying.
This will make a difference in how long it takes to copy.  You may
reduce your time for an entire 9 GB disk from somthing like 8 hours to 2.

I have used 8 MB in the past, but you can change this to match your 
particular system's setup.
	bs=8192k


Step 4
------
You can add this to root's cron so it will run nightly or on the fly.

	dd if=/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s2 of=/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2 bs=8192k
