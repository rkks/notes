Dear Freeserve member,

As you may already be aware, following reports on the news and in the
press, there is a new email virus that began being transmitted yesterday,
it can be identified by the subject line "ILOVEYOU" 

Immediately the virus was identified Freeserve took steps to prevent it
spreading to our users and also prevent any Freeserve user passing on the
virus to other parties.

There is, however, the possibility that you may have received an infected
email before our security measures were put in place. If you have an email
in your inbox with the subject "ILOVEYOU" and have not yet opened it then
simply deleting it will ensure that your PC is not affected, it would also
be worth deleting the mail from the deleted folder as an extra precaution. 

In the unfortunate event that you have opened the mail and the attachment
you will need to clean your PC using antivirus software that has the
latest virus update installed. Alternatively you can visit the following
website and use their online virus scanning tool,

http://housecall.antivirus.com/housecall/start_corp.asp

For future reference it is worth remembering that any email with
attachments where you are not absolutely certain of the origin should be
treated with suspicion. 

I hope that this clarifies the current situation and reassures you that
Freeserve takes your security very seriously indeed. 

Regards

Chris Fletcher,
Customer Service Manager, Freeserve
