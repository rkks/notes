Problem: 
RAID Manager (v6.22 only) incorrectly calculates the capacity of a RAID 5, 10 disk LUN. 
The calculated value that it displays is 1 MB greater than the actual maximum capacity, 
therefore it returns:
	"Auto configure failed" or "Wrong number of drives entered for the RAID level given"

Workaround: 
Manually change the capacity under the "options" gui and lower the value by 1 MB, then click the 
"Create" button.
