Why can't I ftp to a server if I can telnet to it?
--------------------------------------------------


Probably one of two files you need to check.

1) /etc/ftpusers
     From the ftpusers manpage:
     The /etc/ftpusers is an ASCII file that lists users for
     whom ftp login privileges are disallowed.

2) /etc/shells
     From the shells manpage:
     The shells file contains a list of the shells on the system.
     Applications use this file to determine whether a shell is
     valid.  See getusershell(3C).  For each shell a single line
     should be present, consisting of the shell's path, relative
     to root.
