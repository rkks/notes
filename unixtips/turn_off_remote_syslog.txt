Q. How can I keep syslog from accepting messages from remote servers?  How do
I turn of port 514 when doing netstat -an?

A. You need to run syslog with the '-t' option.

Edit /etc/init.d/syslog
and change the line that reads:
	/usr/sbin/syslogd >/dev/msglog 2>&1 &
to
	/usr/sbin/syslogd -t >/dev/msglog 2>&1 &
