Creating an alternate keyboard sequence for the BREAK signal on dumb terminal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following patches introduce a new option to the kbd command
---------------------------------------------------------------  
Solaris 2.6 patch 105924-10 or greater
Solaris 7   patch 107589-02 or greater
Solaris 8   patch is integrated

  
The patch allows the keyboard sequence of ~^b to be used instead
of the BREAK signal on a dumb terminal console attached to the serial port.  

The "alternate" flag is not discussed by "man kbd".



Here are the instructions to enable the alternate keyboard sequence. 

Step 1.  Install patch 105924-10 on 2.6 and patch 107589-02 on 7.

Step 2.  reboot the machine.  

Step 3.  A root user can now turn on the alternate break sequence with the
         following command:

	  #kbd -a alternate

Now the new Break sequence is ~^b.  

Example:
To bring the system to the OK prompt (assuming the console is on the 
serial port) send the following key sequences:

  # <cr>
  # ~^b


The following procedure will also enable the alternate keyboard sequence

Step 1.  Install patch 105924-10 on 2.6 and patch 107589-02 on 2.7.

Step 2.  Modify the /etc/default/kbd file, by removing the # from the entry:

  #KEYBOARD_ABORT=enable

  and changing it to:

  KEYBOARD_ABORT=alternate

Step 3.  reboot

Any user logged in at the dumb console will be able to issue the alternate 
break signal with the following key sequences:

  # <cr>
  # ~^b

NOTE: It is not possible to set an alternate BREAK on Netra systems.

NOTE: On servers with a physical keyswitch, the alternate BREAK does not work
when the key is set to the Secure position.  

NOTE: Solaris 8 does not require a patch for the new kbd option.  
"In Solaris 8, the alternate break key is defined by the driver for the 
serial device (i.e. zs driver). The man page for zs in Solaris 8  says that
the alternate break sequence is "<RETURN> ~ ^B"  
(carriage return - tilde - control B)."
