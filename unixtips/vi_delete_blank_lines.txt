How to delete blank lines within vi?

Just type this baby in:

	<esc>:g/^$/d


NOTE:  This means that all the lines that just have a 
       carriage return on them (NO Spaces), will be removed.




Ok, so I have some of those lines too.  How can I remove all of them as well?

	<esc>:g/^ *$/d


NOTE: There is a space after the '^' and before the '*'.
