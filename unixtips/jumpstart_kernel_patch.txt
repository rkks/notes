SYNOPSIS: Adding a Kernel Patch to a JumpStart Installation Boot Image

DESCRIPTION 

This document describes installing a Kernel Patch to a Net (JumpStart) Install Boot Image, and incorporating this
patch to the completed installation of the OS which is automated once the patch is added as described below. Only
a kernel patch can be installed because the SolStart script for installing patches does not support using a patch
order file at this time. 

When is this useful? 

1) This will work when the "Operating Environment CDROM" and therefore the modify_install_server script is not
available (See SRDB 20576). Also note that the modify_install_server script adds packages and patches for the
PGX32 frame buffer, which may not be necessary in your particular instance. 

2) This is also useful if you are JumpStarting Solaris 2.6 5/98 to an Enterprise Server with 400MHZ cpus with 8mb
cache (See SRDB 20149). 

Following are instructions with an example of this on a Solaris 2.6 5/98 install image at
/export/Install/2.6_598/Solaris_2.6/Tools/Boot:: 

1) Copy the kernel patch to the /tmp directory then patch the boot portion of the Install Image. 

Example: 
	#patchadd -C /export/Install/2.6_598/Solaris_2.6/Tools/Boot -M /tmp 105181-17 

/export/Install/2.6_598 = Install Image Path (yours may differ) 

Solaris_2.6 = Product Name Directory 

105181-17 = 2.6 Kernel Patch 


This will update the boot image patch directory as follows: 
	/export/Install/2.6_598/Solaris_2.6/Tools/Boot/tmp/root/var/sadm/patch 

The default patches in this directory are: 
	105633-05 105654-03 105874-01 105924-03 

After "patchadd -C" completes, the contents are: 
	105181-17 105633-05 105654-03 105874-01 105924-03 

2) Copy the kernel patch to the Patches directory of the install image: 

Patches directory example: 
	/export/Install/2.6_598/Solaris_2.6/Patches/105181-17 

The default patches in this directory are: 
	105570-01 105633-05 105654-03 105924-03 106040-03

Notes: 
------
These patches will install in sequential order, so the kernel patch (105181-17) will install first. 
This can be confirmed in the installation finish log in the /var/sadm/system/logs/finish.log_'date' file. 
The patch_finish script is located in the 
	./Solaris_2.6/Tools/Boot/usr/sbin/install.d/install_config 
directory of the install image.
