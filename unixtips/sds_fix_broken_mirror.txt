If one of your DiskSuite / SVM mirrors went bad (for your root disk) and now you
have 1/2 or less of your metadb's, the system won't boot.  

You have to do a couple of things to convince it otherwise.

a)  Run: metadb -i or format
to see which disk is having the problem.
Format will tell you something like "drive type unknown" on the bad disk and by
looking at the other metadb entries, it should be fairly obvious which disk is bad.

b) Delete the metadb's on the bad disk:
metadb -d c1t0d0s7

c) Remount root as writable so you can continue to boot:
mount -o remount /

d) Type: exit 
to continue booting from single-user mode.
