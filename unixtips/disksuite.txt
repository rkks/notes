How to Setup Solstice DiskSuite / Solaris Volume Manager

Common to both options below:
1.	Create identical partitioning on the second disk
		dd if=/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s2 of=/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2 count=16
2.	Setup the state databases with 3 backups per slice on each disk
		metadb -a -f -c 3 c0t0d0s7 c0t1d0s7

For all slices except root
--------------------------	
Description	Mirror Name		Device Name
1st mirror	d4			c0t0d0s4
2nd mirror	d5			c0t1d0s4
Metamirror	d3			/dev/md/dsk/d3

1.	Create submirrors for the mirrors
		a) metainit -f d4 1 1 c0t0d0s4
		b) metainit d3 -m d4
		c) metainit d5 1 1 c0t1d0s4
2.	Make a backup of the /etc/vfstab file before editing it
3.	Make the following change in the /etc/vfstab file
		/dev/md/dsk/d3	/dev/md/rdsk/d3	/usr	ufs   1	 no   -
4.	Reboot
5.	Attach the submirror to the metamirror
		metattach d3 d5 	(NOTE:  There will be lots of disk I/O)

For the root slice only
-----------------------
Description	Mirror Name		Device Name
1st mirror	d1			c0t0d0s0
2nd mirror	d2			c0t1d0s0
Metamirror	d0			/dev/md/dsk/d0

1.	Create submirrors for the mirrors
		a) metainit -f d1 1 1 c0t0d0s0
		b) metainit d0 -m d1
		c) metainit d2 1 1 c0t1d0s0
2.	Make a backup of the /etc/vfstab file
3.	Let the metaroot command make the /etc/vfstab and /etc/system changes for you
		metaroot d0
4.	Run lockfs to prevent problems
		lockfs -fa
5.	Shutdown the server
		/usr/sbin/shutdown -y -g0 -i0 
6. 	From the boot prompt, run 
		show-disks
7.	Pick your mirrored disk from the list and then setup an alias like so
		nvalias mirror ^y   (that is a <control>-y to paste the device path)
8.	Change your boot-device to first try the normal disk alias, then use your mirror disk
		setenv boot-device disk mirror
9.	Reset/reboot the server
		reset-all
10.	Attach the submirror to the metamirror
		metattach d0 d2 	(NOTE:  There will be lots of disk I/O)
11.	Do an ls and copy the info down as this is the alternate boot path
		ls -l /dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s0


If you only have two mirrored root disks (DiskSuite 4.2.1, Solaris 8), put this setting in your /etc/system:
	set md:mirrored_root_flag=1
