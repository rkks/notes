Question
--------
How can I disable a Sun server from broadcasting/announcing itself to
clients that the server is running X?  I do still want to use it as a
GUI workstation, but just not have others pick it from a list in Exceed.

The following file:
	/usr/dt/config/Xaccess 
is the file you need to copy to:
	/etc/dt/config/Xaccess 
and make the appropriate changes
(else you will lose your changes upon upgrading).
