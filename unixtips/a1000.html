</p><p>If you have recently installed an A1000 along with all of the needed
patches and RAID software (i.e. RAID Manager 6.1.1 Update 2) and you can't
see your RAID modules upon running 'rm6', you may need to reset the RDAC
cache on your A1000. This document explains how to do that. If you have
any questions, <a href="mailto:robert@rootprompt.net">email me</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>To begin with, the following steps are 1 way to reset the A1000 to its
original state:
</p><p>For each of the disks, do the following. This is a way to try and find
a
<br>clean RDAC cache:
</p><p>A1000 reset
<br>SYNOPSIS: Reset configuration in A1000 (original configuration)
<br>DETAIL DESCRIPTION:
</p><p>To reset the configuration on an A1000 back to its original state (LUN
0):
</p><p>1. Power the A1000 down and power system down
<br>2. Remove all of the drives but the first one (far left)
<br>3. Remove the battery unit from the back
<br>4. Wait at least 60 seconds and put battery back in
<br>5. Power unit on and bring system up
<br>6. Start rm6
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; --Verify at this point you are at a default config.&nbsp;
If not go back to step 1 and use a different drive.
<br>7. Plug drives in one at a time, waiting about 10 seconds between each.
</p><p><b><font color="#ff0000">--OR--</font></b>
</p><p>You can save yourself the time and energy of going through each of the
12 disks by doing the following:
</p><p>1. Remove all disks from A1000.
<br>2. Free up c0t1d0 on the server.
<br>3. Place a disk from the A1000 into c0t1d0 on the server.
<br>4. Run 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2 bs=10240'
<br>5. Place disk in c0t1d0 back in A1000 in the leftmost bay.
<br>6. reboot -- -r
<br>7. Start rm6 and make sure you have a default config.
<br>8. Plug drives in one at a time, waiting about 10 seconds between each.
</p><p>This will clean up any corrupted RDAC and since there is no RDAC on
the A1000 leftmost disk (the only disk available), one will be created.
