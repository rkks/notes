Playing audio CD's automagically
--------------------------------
One of the features of volume management is that it allows you to configure
audio CDs to auto-play when they are inserted into the CD-ROM drive. You can
download a program called WorkMan (http://www.midwinter.com/workman), 
which allows you to listen to audio CDs.

In order to configure volume management to auto-play the CDs with workman, 
add the following line to the "removable media mounter" configuration file,
/etc/rmmount.conf:

action cdrom action_workman.so /usr/openwin/bin/workman


NOTE: This line should be added before the line that says: 
	action cdrom action_filemgr.so



For Jaz and Zip Drives
----------------------
You can also use volume management to mount Imoega Jaz and Zip disks 
by adding the following line to the /etc/vold.conf file:

use rmscsi drive /dev/rdsk/c*s2 dev_rmscsi.so rmscsi%d

Then, to eject a Jaz or Zip disk, use the following command:

# eject rmscsi
