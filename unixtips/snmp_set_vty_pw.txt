Can I change the vty or enable password with the SNMP RW string?

Question 
--------
I accidentally removed a password on a remote router and I can't access it anymore. 
I receive the follow error:  
	"Password required, but none set." 
Since I have the SNMP ReadWrite (RW) community string, can I change it?


Answer
------
Yes, you can change the configuration with the SNMP RW community string.  
Use the following command:
NOTE:  The following should be typed on one long line.  
       The '\' is not actually part of the string

snmpset -t 10 -r 5 -c communityname hostname .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.53.150.150.150.150 \
        octetstring configfile.txt

Where
-----
150.150.150.150 is the address of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server 

hostname is the hostname of the router (or its IP address)

configfile.txt is the file containing the configuration commands that you wish to  
implement (this file must be in a directory reachable by TFTP to the TFTP server)



Example of configfile.txt
-------------------------
no enable secret
enable secret newpassword
end
