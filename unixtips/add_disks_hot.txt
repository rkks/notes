After plugging the disks in, do a:
	drvconfig
	disks	(for SCSI disks)
	tapes	(for tape drive)
	ports	(for serial ports)
	devlinks	
	
Also, if you forgot to power on your external cdrom before turing your server on, and it shows up in "sysdef" as:
	 (driver not attached)
do a:
	drvconfig cdrom
It should now appear in a "sysdef".
