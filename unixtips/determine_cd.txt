Hi All,


Thanks for all the numerous responses to my questions. There are too many
to mention here. Most of you got it right . The original directory that
was used to mount the partition did not have the right permissions.


I unmounted the filesystem, chmod 755 the mount point, and remounted it and it solves the problem.
The funny thing is that some operations seem to work, like touch, but others
complain about incorrect permissions.


My backspace and delete problems also goes away because I have already set
it up in my .profile . Previously it seems that the .profile was not read due
to permissions problem.


Well, thanks everbody.

My orginal question was:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was trying to set up a new SUN Ultra 60 but I am getting a lot of problems.
I created a new ksh local account and when I log in I get a message in the
text window (dtterm)

"Warning: cannot determine current directory"

When I do a pwd I get the same message as below :-

pwd: cannot determine current directory!


also I keep getting ^H and ^? when use the delete and Backspace
in dtterm . Also I cannot get # key when using vi


Does anybody knows what is happening ?

Many thanks for your help.

Regards
