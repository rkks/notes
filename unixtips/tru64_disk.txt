Q. How can I figure out what the SCSI ID is for a particular device is?

A. Use file as root.

Example:
        server# file /dev/rrz0c
        /dev/rrz0c: character special (8/2) SCSI #0 RZ24 disk #0 (SCSI ID #0)

You can also use some wildcards here:
	server# file /dev/rrz*c
	server# file /dev/rrz?c
