Q. How can I create an account that only allows FTP access and not telnet?

A. Create the account as you normally would in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
   Then, for the shell, type something like:
	/bin/ftponly

   Now, create the file ftponly:
	echo 'echo "This account only allows FTP access."' > /bin/ftponly
   and allow it to be executable:
	chmod a+x /bin/ftponly

   To make this "shell" a valid one according to FTP, append the following line in /etc/shells:
	/bin/ftponly


NOTE:  If this is the only line in the file, you should go ahead and add the other valid shells
       for FTP so everyone can still get in as you will be overriding the default list.


From the shells man page:
     The shells file contains a list of the shells on the system.
     Applications use this file to determine whether a shell is valid. 
     See getusershell(3C). For each shell a single line should be
     present, consisting of the shell's path, relative to root.


   Now when users try to login with telnet, they will see the following message:
	This account only allows FTP access.
