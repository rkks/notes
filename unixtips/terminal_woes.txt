Problem
-------
The systems does not boot up if a terminal is not connected to serial port.
I mean, when I issue the reboot command, system simply locks at the
stage loading the OS (i.e. the rotating / sign) and waits until a terminal
connected. The system can wait at this stage for days and starts to boot up
as soon as a termial is connected.


Solution
--------
From the OK prompt :
		setenv ttya-ignore-cd true

Basically you've got the system set to wait until CD (carrier detect)
comes up until it will boot.
