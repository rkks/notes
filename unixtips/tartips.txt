Tar tips
--------
If moving files from one machine to another using NFS mounted FS's,
it is better to do the reads over the network and the writes locally.


To move whole directory structures from the current directory to a 
target directory or filesystem:
	tar cpf - . | (cd todir && tar xvpf -)
	

From the tar man page:
     p         Restore the named files to their  original  modes,
               and  ACLs  if  applicable,  ignoring  the  present
               umask(1). This is the default behavior if  invoked
               as  super-user  with  the x function letter speci-
               fied. If super-user, SETUID and sticky information
               are  also  extracted,  and files are restored with
               their original owners and permissions, rather than
               owned by root. When this function modifier is used
               with the c function, ACLs are created in the  tar-
               file  along  with  other  information. Errors will
               occur when a tarfile with  ACLs  is  extracted  by
               previous versions of tar .
