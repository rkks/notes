Accidentally removed/renamed a critical library file and can't get it back?
(one of these solutions should work even if your problem is with a different file)


Q. 
While testing something, I renamed /usr/lib/libc.so.1 to
something else and now I cannot even run the "mv" command.
Needless to say I cannot ftp/telnet to/from to that box.

How do I bring this box back to normal ??


A.
To resolve the problem, if there was no root window
when either the libc.so or the ld.so was removed,
boot up the system to single user mode.

   L1-a > b -s -w

(This boots up single user mode and makes /usr partition writable).

If the ld.so file was moved to another name such as
ld.so.l, within the /usr/lib directory:

   cd /usr/lib
   mv ld.so.l ld.so

2)
If the new filename cannot be recalled, or if a directory
listing is needed, the tar command can be used.  Unlike
the "ls" command, it doesn't require shared libraries.

   cd /usr/lib
   tar cvf /dev/null ld*
   
3)
The echo command can also be used to list directories:
   echo *
   
4)
If the file is a text file, you may be able to use cat to copy a file
to a different name.  For example:
   cat some_filename_it_shouldnt_be > correct filename
