* Logging #bsrf to '#bsrf.log'
<GoLdDeMoN> raven, do u know how they find out info after ur hd has been 
formatted?
<jobber-d> im logging right now
<|BaRoN1|> NM...
<Raven> |BaRoN1|, GMT is Greenwich Mean Time (Greenwich is where the 
diagonal uhm line thingi, whatever they call it in english, goes through)
<Raven> GoLdDeMoN, that's easy
<jobber-d> the degree?
<Raven> hey i'll lecture on that
<Raven> ok is everyone ready?
<jobber-d> yes
<Raven> |BaRoN1| ok
<jobber-d> im logging
<|BaRoN1|> what r u doing here in such late houre?
<Raven> |BaRoN1| it's the summer vacation dammit
<RedShadow> meridian, is what its called
<Raven> ohh and just for the sake of it...
*** Raven sets mode: +vvvv jobber-d Blade dvx RedShadow
*** Raven sets mode: +vvvv GoLdDeMoN snider Hatch seek3r
*** Raven sets mode: +v EBULA
<Raven> :-)
<jobber-d> lol
<|BaRoN1|> ohhh ... i`m allways forget ...
<Raven> alright let's make it quick
<RedShadow> you don't want to incite a riot like last time
<Raven> RedShadow that's why i didn't use /mop
<Raven> so anyway...
<Raven> suppose you have some sensitive data on your hd
<Raven> something reeeally sensitive
<Raven> something that the fbi would like to lay it's hands on
<Raven> well actually fbi would like to lay it's hands on many things
<jobber-d> like my nads
<Raven> especially at the time when Jay Edgar Hoover was in charge...
<Raven> uhm nevermind forget it, sick little joke
<Raven> which involves crossdressers and handcuffs, forget it
<Raven> so anyway
<jobber-d> :)
<Raven> suppose you want to get rid of ANY traces at all
<Raven> so the feds won't find anything
<|BaRoN1|> ...i`m blushing ...
<Raven> and won't play the jailhouse rock, as elvis would have said
<Raven> ok first i'll tell u how the fbi recovers files
<Hatch> encrypt the the disk !!
<Raven> so anyway your hard drive has some sectors on it called FATs - File 
Allocation Tables
<Raven> and these sectors contain the locations of all the files
<Raven> when u delete a file, it is removed from the FAT
<jobber-d> raven: does this apply to linux disks?
<Raven> but not from the disk...
<Raven> jobber-d yes
<Raven> even to diskettes
<Raven> and tape drives too, i think
<snider> same concept anyways
<Raven> so anyway the fbi can use a tool that reads the raw data that's on 
the hd
<Raven> and browse through it
<Raven> eventually they'll find the data
<snider> like debug.exe
<Raven> because it wasn't deleted from the disk
<Raven> it was just removed from the FAT
<GoLdDeMoN> so wouldn't u be losing space over time even if u delete things?
<Raven> what u can do is either use file shredding utilities
<Raven> or encrypt the file
<Raven> GoLdDeMoN no, eventually things get overwritten after they are 
deleted
<snider> gold, you can legally write to sectors that have no FAT entry
<Raven> snider that's right
<snider> :)
*** Ghost_Rider has joined #bsrf
<Ghost_Rider> hi guys
<Ghost_Rider> hi raven
<jobber-d> eh ghost! mini-lecture
<Ghost_Rider> snider
<Ghost_Rider> jobber
<Hatch> what's the address of the fat in the disk raven?
<Raven> now file shredding utilities scramble the file, toss it, garble it, 
pee on it and stomp on it a little and then reset it to zero and only then 
delete it
<Raven> yeah a spontaneous one, ghost
<Hatch> 0000:0000?
<jobber-d> ill send you the log once its done
<Raven> encryption, on the other hand, will overwrite the file with an 
encrypted one
<GoLdDeMoN> where can u get file shredding utilities?
<Hatch> hey ghost
<Raven> and then u can delete it
<Raven> GoLdDeMoN there's one for windows which i know, it's called file 
shredder
<snider> hatch, right after the master boot record is the first partitions 
FAT
<Ghost_Rider> talking about how to really delete files right?
<Raven> dunno any for linux, i never used these things, and i only came 
across the windows one by accident
<jobber-d> correct
<Raven> hey u think the others would be interested to hear this?
<Raven> maybe u could send me the logs
<GoLdDeMoN> do u know where to get the raw data viewing utility?
<Raven> barakirs@netvision.net.il, later
<jobber-d> ill snd the logs
<Ghost_Rider> Raven: if you now the offsets where to write you can use an 
asm program to write 0 on them
<Raven> just don't flood me
<Raven> :-)
<Raven> GoLdDeMoN i think Partition Magic does that
<jobber-d> :)
<Ghost_Rider> raven
<GoLdDeMoN> thanx
<Ghost_Rider> did you check the tut?
<Raven> or Norton Rescue, uhm... something, i don't remember how it's called
<Raven> ok that's it, if u want to send me your logs, cut them here
<Raven> -- cut --
<snider> everyone, you can use the -l funcion from debug.exe to wiev data, 
its almost too easy
<Raven> Ghost_Rider yes, u can continue your work
<snider> hehe
