<p><b><font size="4"><a name="1"></a>X. Introduction</font></b></p>
<p>This FAQ describes how to break-in to a PC (IBM-Compatible) from the outside 
  in, and how to bypass some common software-based security measures. The last 
  section details how to secure your PC against most of such attacks.</p>
<p>Many of these solutions assume you have physical access to the PC. For example, 
  you can't extract the hard disk or reset the CMOS over a network, but you can 
  do it if you have access to the computer.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="2"></a>1. Hardware and Firmware</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="3"></a>1a. The BIOS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="4"></a>Passwords</b></font><br>
  <br>
  The BIOS, short for Basic Input/Output Services, is the control program of the 
  PC. It is responsible for starting up your computer, transferring control of 
  the system to the operating system, and for handling other low-level functions, 
  such as disk access.</p>
<p>NOTE that the BIOS is not a software program, insofar as it is not purged from 
  memory when you turn off the computer. It's firmware, meaning it is permanently 
  and unchangeably stored in the machine. FLASH BIOS Systems, such as those from 
  Phoenix and AMI, allow you update the BIOS through software, but that's another 
  FAQ.</p>
<p>A convenient little feature that most BIOS manufacturers include is a startup 
  password. This prevents access to the system until you enter the correct password. 
</p>
<p>If you can get access to the system after the password has been entered, then 
  there is a software-based BIOS password extractor available from:</p>
<p><a href="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/simtel/msdos/sysutil/amis2990.zip">ftp://oak.oakland.edu/simtel/msdos/sysutil/amis2990.zip</a></p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="5"></a>Resetting the CMOS</b></font><br>
  <br>
  There is only one other way to get past the BIOS password. It involves discharging 
  the static memory (CMOS) used to store the password and other system information. 
  Once it is discharged, however, you have to reset all the system settings by 
  hand.</p>
<p>****Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start up the computer a. If the system allows it, enter the Setup Screen 
    (Usually by pressing F1, DEL or INS during the memory check)</li>
  <li>Record all the Setup Information. Double Check.</li>
  <li>Turn off the computer</li>
  <li>Remove the casing, and put the computer on the ground in such a way that 
    you can see and access the side of the motherboard with the processor on it.</li>
  <li> Look at the motherboard</li>
  <li>If you can see a round, disc-like battery, then remove it, and let the computer 
    sit without the battery for 15-30 minutes. Put the battery back in.</li>
  <li>If you have access to the circuit diagrams for the motherboard, look in 
    there for the password or CMOS jumper. Flip it on and off.</li>
  <li>Look for a blue, soldered-in battery with a jumper running off of it. This 
    jumper is for connecting an external battery. Pull it out for 15-30 min. to 
    reset the CMOS.</li>
  <li>Replace the computer casing.</li>
  <li> Enter the Setup Screen, and set the Setup Information back to the original 
    values that you (hopefully) recorded. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you were unable to record the setup info, then you'll just have to set it 
  up manually. Some newer Plug &amp; Play BIOSes have an autodetect feature that 
  automatically sets-up the hard disk and other items.</p>
<p>Again, I would like to mention that there are numerous password extractors 
  available for free off the internet and on BBSes. Try those first: they are 
  much cleaner and easier-to-use.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="6"></a>1b. Floppy Locks</b></font></p>
<p>Floppy Locks are generally cheap plastic inserts that hook on to the inside 
  of the drive and lock it, thereby preventing you from using the floppy drive. 
  The locks used are usually those little swivel locks used in computer casings 
  to lock the keyboard.</p>
<p>There ARE some very secure locks, with *unique* keys. Such locks are not sold 
  at your local computer store, and must be obtained directly from a factory in 
  Nice, France (didn't get the name, though.). There is a distributor in Canada 
  by the name of &quot;Kappa Micro&quot;.</p>
<p>If the lock is of the swivel type, you can either pick it, or buy a key (they're 
  all the same).</p>
<p><a name="7"></a>To pick it, you'll need a *thin* flathead screwdriver or a 
  paperclip. To pick the lock, take the paperclip and insert it into the little 
  notch on the inside of the swivel lock. Now, pull to the opposite side of the 
  lock until the swivel is in the unlocked position.</p>
<p><a name="8"></a>If you choose to buy a key, you can:</p>
<p> A. Go to your local computer service center, and buy one of these keys. (Very 
  cheap. Often less than<br>
  $0.75) B. Buy the same brand of floppy lock, and use the key that comes with 
  it.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="9"></a>1c. Last Resorts</b></font></p>
<p>If you are *REALLY* desperate to access this PC, then the following *might* 
  work:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name="10"></a>Remove the PC Casing</li>
  <li>Extract the hard disk (By unscrewing and disconnecting)</li>
  <li>Transfer it to another computer. (Make sure that it is NOT set as the boot 
    drive.)</li>
  <li>Start up this computer, and access the hard disk from there.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will probably not work if an encrypted file system is in use. The only 
  way to access such disks is to enter the password, or figure out a way to decrypt 
  it, so if you forget your password, you're hosed. :(</p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="11"></a>2. DOS, Windows, and Netware</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="12"></a>2a. Getting access to DOS</b></font></p>
<p>Some systems, are set up to boot directly to some sort of shell/security program, 
  like Windows, or Windows 95. If you want to get access to a DOS prompt, you 
  have some choices:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Boot from a floppy disk</li>
  <li>Bypass startup files</li>
  <li>Bypassing DriveSpace</li>
  <li> Break out of Autoexec.bat</li>
</ol>
<p> <a name="13"></a>***Booting from a floppy requires you to create a system 
  disk. You can do this using the DOS command FORMAT A: /S which will format a 
  disk and place system files on it. Also, the Windows format (In File Manager 
  or Explorer) has an option allowing you to create a system floppy.</p>
<p>Before you create a system disk, you must determine which floppy drive is used 
  to boot. If the system has both a 1.2MB (5.25&quot;) Floppy Drive and a 1.44MB 
  (3.5&quot;) Drive, it is likely that the boot drive is the 1.2 MB floppy drive. 
  If the computer has only one floppy drive, it is quite safe to assume that it 
  is the boot drive.</p>
<p>However, if you are unsure as to which drive is the boot drive, you can either 
  find out by entering System Setup (as described in section 1) or by observing 
  which floppy drive is read right before the operating system loads.</p>
<p>If the system is set to boot only from the hard disk, then you can refer to 
  Section 1 on how to reset the CMOS.</p>
<p>Once you have a system disk, you place it in the floppy drive, and turn on 
  or reset the computer. If you have done everything right, the computer will 
  boot from the floppy drive and you will have access to a DOS prompt.</p>
<p>This technique, of course, can be prevented through the use of a floppy lock, 
  and by setting the BIOS to boot only from the hard disk.</p>
<p><a name="14"></a>***Bypassing startup files is quite simple, but only works 
  on versions of DOS 6.0 or better and Windows 95. When you turn on the computer 
  and you see the text:</p>
<p> Starting MS-DOS ...</p>
<p>or<br>
  Starting PC-DOS ...</p>
<p>or <br>
  Starting Windows 95 ...</p>
<p>Press and hold the SHIFT or F5 key IMMEDIATELY. This will bypass the startup 
  files (CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT) as long as the system administrator has 
  not disabled this feature.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can press and hold F8 when the startup text shows to enter 
  the Boot menu. This lets you selectively disable certain commands, or bypass 
  the startup files totally, among other things.</p>
<p><a name="15"></a>***Bypassing DriveSpace works if compression software such 
  as DriveSpace or DoubleSpace has been installed. If so, when the startup text 
  displays, press and hold Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+F8. This will load the system without 
  loading the compression driver, which means you can't access the files on disk. 
</p>
<p>HOWEVER, you *can* decompress the disk (DriveSpace only), as long as you have 
  sufficient disk space or enough floppies. </p>
<p>If all else fails, you can format it or take it to a Specialized Data Recovery 
  service. They can probably recover the files by moving them to a larger hard 
  disk and decompressing. </p>
<p><a name="16"></a>***Breaking out of AUTOEXEC.BAT is rather simple also. When 
  the computer starts up and the operating system starts loading, press Ctrl+Break 
  (Or Ctrl+C) repeatedly. When the AUTOEXEC.BAT executes, this will terminate 
  it and drop you to DOS. This will work unless the keyboard has been disabled, 
  or is inactive during initialization (Drivers can be loaded in CONFIG.SYS which 
  temporarily disable the keyboard, and then re-enable it with a command at the 
  end of AUTOEXEC.BAT)</p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="17"></a>2b. Getting to DOS from Windows</b></font></p>
<p>If the above tactics fail, and the machine automatically loads Windows, then 
  you still have a very good chance of getting to DOS. Since Windows by default 
  gives you free access to DOS, there are special security programs made specifically 
  to prevent the user from accessing it, among other things. Most of these programs 
  can be bypassed.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="18"></a>Password Protection</b></font><br>
  <br>
  If when Windows starts up you are presented with yet another password dialog 
  box, analyze the situation:</p>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="19"></a>Windows Login</b></font><br>
  <br>
  If this is the Primary Windows Login or a Network login, then you can get past 
  it by pressing the Cancel button (No Joke!) to log on as the Default user. This 
  is because the Login information is used primarily for desktop preferences and 
  remote file sharing.</p>
<p>the Default user, however, can be secured. If this is done, then it is virtually 
  impossible to gain access through it. The only way to do this is by a series 
  of registry entries, which are listed in the appendix at the bottom of this 
  file.</p>
<p>Login passwords are stored in .PWL files in the Windows directory. You can 
  reset all accounts to no password by using the .PWL renaming technique described 
  below. </p>
<p>The filename of the .PWL file corresponds to the login name of that user. For 
  example, Olcay.pwl contains the encrypted passwords for the account &quot;Olcay&quot;.</p>
<p>The password protection in Windows 95 uses a much stronger algorithm, but you 
  can still bypass it by *carefully* moving or renaming all .PWL files in the 
  C:\Windows directory. The password filenames are also stored in the SYSTEM.INI 
  file.</p>
<p>So, to disable passwords:</p>
<p> CD \WINDOWS<br>
  REN *.PWL *.PW_</p>
<p>Similarly, to re-enable passwords:</p>
<p> CD \WINDOWS<br>
  REN *.PW_ *.PWL</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><font size="3"><a name="20"></a>Third-Party Password</font></b><br>
  <br>
  If this is a third-party security program, such as the one built-in to After 
  Dark, try pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del when the dialog is presented to you. Most security 
  programs go out of their way to be secure, and Windows 3.1 interprets this as 
  not responding to the system, and thus will allow you close it. Windows 95 pops 
  up a neat little dialog box that lets you terminate any running application. 
  How convenient. :) Once you subvert this, you can prevent it from bothering 
  you again by editing the LOAD= and RUN= sections in C:\WINDOWS\WIN.INI.</p>
<p><br>
  <font size="3"><b><a name="21"></a>Screensavers</b></font><br>
  <br>
  The password protection built-in to the Windows 3.1 screensavers is extremely 
  weak. You can bypass it by editing CONTROL.INI and searching for the Password 
  field. Delete the junk that appears after the equal sign (This is an encrypted 
  password).</p>
<p>To disable Windows 95 passwords, right-click on the desktop and select Properties, 
  choose the Screen Saver tab, and uncheck &quot;Password protected&quot;.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="22"></a>Windows-Based Security</b></font><br>
  <br>
  If Windows starts up, and Program Manager loads, but the File menu is disabled, 
  and access to DOS has been cut off, or some other oppressive security measures 
  are in place, fear not. There are ways around such programs, as shall be explained 
  below:</p>
<p><br>
  <b><font size="3"><a name="23"></a>DOS through OLE</font></b><br>
  <br>
  OLE, for Object Linking and Embedding, was hailed as a great advance in the 
  Windows Operating System by letting you embed or link objects (this includes 
  Executables) in documents.</p>
<p>Scorpion pointed out that Object Packager, which lets you package embedded 
  files with icons, could be used to access DOS (or run any program) from most 
  OLE-enabled applications (Like Write, WordPad, Word, etc.) Based on this information, 
  I found a similar hole that doesn't require Object Packager but still exploits 
  OLE. Both of these work in Windows 3.x and up.</p>
<p>Using Object Packager:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start up Write or WordPad</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Object&quot; from the &quot;Insert&quot; menu</li>
  <li>The location of the Insert Object command may vary. Look Around.</li>
  <li>Choose Package from the list, and click OK</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Import&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu</li>
  <li> Enter C:\COMMAND.COM, and select OK</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Update&quot; Under the &quot;File&quot; menu</li>
  <li>Go back to your document, and double click on the COMMAND.COM icon</li>
</ol>
<p>Using Insert:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start up Write or WordPad</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Object&quot; from the &quot;Insert&quot; menu</li>
  <li>Again, the location of the Insert Object command may vary. Look Around.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Create from File&quot;</li>
  <li>Enter C:\COMMAND.COM as the filename</li>
  <li>Click OK, go back to your document, and double click on the COMMAND.COM 
    icon<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="24"></a>DOS through Write</b></font><br>
  <br>
  This works by saving COMMAND.COM, the DOS executable, over WINHELP.EXE, the 
  Windows Help program. Unfortunately, this tactic will not work with Windows 
  95. WordPad, the Word Processing Applet that comes with Windows 95, prevents 
  the user from loading executable files.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go into Accessories, and start up Write (*NOT* NOTEPAD!!)</li>
  <li>Open C:\COMMAND.COM</li>
  <li>A dialog box will pop up. Select &quot;NO CONVERSION&quot;</li>
  <li>Select Save As...</li>
  <li>Save it as C:\WINDOWS\WINHELP.EXE</li>
  <li>If it asks if you want to overwrite WINHELP.EXE, choose YES</li>
  <li>Press F1. Normally, this loads Windows Help, but now it will create a DOS 
    prompt window.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><font size="3"><a name="25"></a>DOS through Word</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Microsoft Word versions 6.0 and above have a built-in macro language called 
  WordBasic. This example works by instructing WordBasic to open up a DOS window.</p>
<p>Most of the Macro languages of popular applications let you do something similar 
  to this technique. Look around in the online help files.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If Microsoft Word is installed, start it up.</li>
  <li>From the Tools Menu, select Macro.</li>
  <li>Type in a Macro name, and click &quot;Create&quot;</li>
  <li>When the Macro window comes up, type in one of the following depending on 
    which Windows you are using:<br>
    For Windows 3.1: Shell Environ$(&quot;COMSPEC&quot;) <br>
    For Windows 95: Shell Environ$(&quot;COMMAND&quot;) <br>
    For Windows NT: Shell Environ$(&quot;CMD&quot;)<br>
    <br>
    If all else fails: Shell &quot;C:\COMMAND.COM&quot;</li>
  <li>Run the macro by pressing the little play button on the macro toolbar. This 
    will launch a DOS prompt.</li>
</ol>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="26"></a>DOS through MODE</b></font><br>
  <br>
  When Windows 95 Shuts Down and shows that dumb graphic, it's really just sitting 
  on top of DOS. You can actually issue DOS commands (although the graphic will 
  cover them) on the system after shutdown!!!</p>
<p>A simple way to do this is to type:</p>
<p> CLS</p>
<p>After the shutdown graphic shows. However, the text will be in 40-column mode, 
  which is hard to read, and incompatible with some programs.</p>
<p>If you want to get a nice, clean DOS prompt, you can type:</p>
<p> MODE CO80</p>
<p>This will reset the screen display to the normal (80-column, 16 color) DOS 
  display mode.</p>
<p>*MOST* Windows Security programs are based on a VxD (Virtual Device), which 
  gives them unprecented power over the system while Windows is running. After 
  shutdown, all Windows-based programs will be unloaded, leaving you free to explore 
  using DOS.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, this doesn't seem to work on some systems.</p>

  <br>
  When Windows 95 Starts up, some systems are set up to show a Windows/Network 
  Login dialog box. You can press either</p>
<p> Ctrl+Alt+Del</p>
<p>Which will let you Shut down the system (and apply the DOS THROUGH MODE technique), 
  End any running tasks, etc. Or:</p>
<p> Ctrl+Esc</p>
<p>Which, since the taskbar hasn't loaded, will launch Task Manager. From this 
  window you can end tasks, run programs, and shutdown the system (again, the 
  DOS THROUGH MODE technique is applicable here). *All* programs are accessible 
  from the run menu, so you can run C:\COMMAND.COM to get access to DOS.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><a name="30"></a>Resetting Netware</b></font><br>
  <br>
  When NetWare is first installed, the account SUPERVISOR and GUEST are left unprotected, 
  that is, with no password. SUPERVISOR has free run of the system. You can do 
  anything you want.</p>
<p>But how can you make the server think it has just been installed without actually 
  reinstalling the server and losing all data on the disk? Simple. You just delete 
  the files that contain the security system! </p>
<p>In Netware 2.x, all security information is stored in two files (NET$BIND.SYS 
  and NET$BVAL.SYS). Netware 3.x stores that information in three files (NET$OBJ.SYS, 
  NET$VAL.SYS and ET$PROP.SYS). The all new Netware 4.x system stores all login 
  names and passwords in five different files (PARTITIO.NDS, BLOCK.NDS, ENTRY.NDS, 
  VALUE.NDS and UNINSTAL.NDS [This last file may not be there, don't worry]).</p>
<p>Although Novell did a very good job encrypting passwords, they left all directory 
  information easy to find and change if you can access the server's disk directly, 
  using common utilities like Norton's Disk Edit. </p>
<p>Using this utility as an example, I'll give a step-by-step procedure to make 
  these files vanish. All you need is a bootable DOS disk, Norton Utilities' Emergency 
  Disk containing the DiskEdit program and some time near the server.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Boot the server and go to the DOS prompt. To do this, just let the network 
    boot normally and then use the DOWN and EXIT commands. This procedure does 
    not work on old Netware 2.x servers and in some installations where DOS has 
    been removed from memory. In those cases, you'll have to use a DOS bootable 
    disk.</li>
  <li>Run Norton's DiskEdit utility from drive A:</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Tools&quot; in the main menu and then select &quot;Configuration&quot;. 
    At the configuration window, uncheck the &quot;Read-Only&quot; checkbox. And 
    be very careful with everything you type after this point.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Object&quot; and then &quot;Drive&quot;. At the window, select 
    the C: drive and make sure you check the button &quot;physical drive&quot;. 
    After that, you'll be looking at your physical disk and you be able to see 
    <br>
    (and change) everything on it.</li>
  <li> Select &quot;Tools&quot; and then &quot;Find&quot;. Here, you'll enter 
    the name of the file you are trying to find. Use &quot;NET$BIND&quot; for 
    Netware 2, &quot;NET$PROP.SYS&quot; for Netware 3 and &quot;PARTITIO.NDS&quot; 
    for Netware 4. It is possible that you find these strings in a place that 
    is not the Netware directory. If the file names are not all near each other 
    and proportionaly separated by some unreadable codes (at least 32 bytes between 
    them), then you it's not the place we are looking for. In that case, you'll 
    have to keep searching by selecting &quot;Tools&quot; and then &quot;Find 
    again&quot;. [In Netware 3.x, you can change all occurences of the bindery 
    files and it should still work okay])</li>
  <li>You found the directory and you are ready to change it. Instead of deleting 
    the files, you'll be renaming them. This will avoid problems with the directory 
    structure (like lost FAT chains). Just type &quot;OLD&quot; over the existing 
    &quot;SYS&quot; or &quot;NDS&quot; extension. Be extremely careful and don't 
    change anything else.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;Tools&quot; and then &quot;Find again&quot;. Since Netware 
    store the directory information in two different places, you have to find 
    the other copy and change it the same way. This will again prevent directory 
    structure problems.</li>
  <li>Exit Norton Disk Edit and boot the server again. If you're running Netware 
    2 or 3, your server would be already accessible. Just go to any station and 
    log in as user Supervisor. No password will be asked. If you're running Netware 
    4, there is one last step.</li>
  <li>Load Netware 4 install utility (just type LOAD INSTALL at the console prompt) 
    and select the options to install the Directory Services. You be prompted 
    for the Admin password while doing this. After that, you may go to any station 
    and log in as user Admin, using the password that you have selected.</li>
</ol>
<p>**NOTE: If Disk Edit is unavailable, any Disk Editing utility with searching 
  capabilities will suffice.</p>

<p><font size="3"><b><a name="33"></a>Potential &quot;Hackers&quot;</b></font><br>
  <br>
  After reading this FAQ, you've probably revised your idea of a secure PC quite 
  a bit. Truth be told, IBM didn't design the Personal Computer with security 
  in mind. Back in 1980, their main objective was to get _something_ to market 
  before Apple gobbled up all the market share.</p>
<p>After awhile, security programs started to emerge that attempted to bridge 
  this gap. These were quite popular, and were put into use by many companies 
  to prevent 'curious' employees from messing with<br>
  the computers.</p>
<p>However, ways to bypass these security programs were quickly found. As long 
  as computers are designed for convenience, and with humans in mind, this will 
  almost always happen.</p>
<p>So, who are potential &quot;Hackers&quot;? The answer is: Anyone. Experienced 
  users especially, but even newbies sometimes find weak spots. This is not to 
  say that everyone *is* a &quot;hacker&quot;. (Note that I use quotes because 
  I don't believe in the popular usage of the term &quot;Hacker&quot;. The media 
  is out of control: their usage of the word has conflated Computer Gurus with 
  Criminals in the minds of the people.)</p>
<p>As always, prevention is the best medicine. The following sections deal with 
  how to secure your system, both through physical and software-based means.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><font size="3"><a name="34"></a>Physical Security</font></b><br>
  <br>
  In the old days, back when computers filled multiple rooms, the security of 
  a system was basically all physical: Locks, security guards, etc. Now the emphasis 
  has shifted away from physical security, and is leaning more towards software-based 
  methods. However, in some cases, a certain degree of physical security is in 
  order.</p>
<p>***If you want to prevent people from resetting your CMOS and accessing the 
  floppy drives, etc. you have to secure the system itself. This can be done by 
  having the computer in a locked room, leaving only the screen and keyboard accessible. 
  There are many products which let you extend the reach of screen and keyboard 
  cables. Even some that let you control many different computers using one screen. 
</p>
<p>***There are also security devices available made by companies such as Anchor 
  Pad, Lucasey, and others that completely enclose the PC. These are devices such 
  as lockdown pads, cables for monitors, and metal boxes. There are also devices 
  that cover and lock the floppy and CD-ROM slots. </p>
<p>***Computer locks which bind your computer to a desk are good for discouraging 
  theft.</p>
<p>***To protect your hard disk data, I would suggest investing in a removable 
  media system that lets you &quot;hot-swap&quot; and lock hard disks. The hard 
  disk could then be easily removed (with the *unique* key) and stored in a safe 
  to prevent theft of data. Drives such as the Zip (100MB), Ditto (800MB), and 
  Jaz (1GB) are removable as well, but do not lock. </p>
<p>Make sure that you test the computer immediately after these lockdown devices 
  are installed. In some instances the stress induced on the casing by the devices 
  can cause certain parts to malfunction.</p>
<p>***You can buy devices that prevent the PC electrical cord from being unplugged 
  or turned on without a key.</p>
<p>***Investing in a UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) System is worth the cost. 
  These protect against power fluxes which can damage your system. In the case 
  of a power out (or if someone trips over the cord), UPS systems give you 5 minutes 
  of rechargeable battery power to save work and perform an emergency shutdown.</p>
<p>***As one last measure of security, it's always nice to invest in some insurance 
  for your computer. It won't get your data back, but it *will* give you some 
  peace of mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="35"></a>Software-Based Security</b></font><br>
  <br>
  Below is a list of measures you can take to secure your system using software/firmware 
  based methods. They are listed in order of increasing security, so minimum security 
  would be only implementing option #1, maximum security would be implementing 
  #1-8. Keep in mind that implementing any of these without implementing every 
  item below it leaves possible entry points open.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set up a BIOS password for both the Setup screen *and* access to the system.</li>
  <li>Make sure the password is not easily guessable (i.e., birthdate, name backwards, 
    etc. are<br>
    easily guessed) See next section.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the password is the maximum possible number of characters 
    supported by the BIOS.</li>
  <li>Disable floppy booting from within the BIOS</li>
  <li>Disable Bypass of startup files</li>
  <li>This is done by adding the line:<br>
    SWITCHES=/F /N<br>
    to the CONFIG.SYS file.</li>
  <li>Additionally, you might want to precede all statements in the Autoexec.bat 
    with CTTY NUL, and then have CTTY CON as the last line. This prevents breaking 
    out of autoexec.bat</li>
  <li>If you use DriveSpace compression, add the following line to your DRVSPACE.INI 
    file:<br>
    SWITCHES=/F /N</li>
  <li>Add the line:<br>
    BREAK OFF<br>
    This reduces the number of chances you have to break out of AUTOEXEC.BAT, 
    all though it doesn't switch it off entirely</li>
  <li>Set up a DOS-based Security TSR</li>
  <li>Make sure you cannot access the floppy drive without a password, and that 
    it allows for write-protection.</li>
  <li>Make sure it allows for password protection.</li>
  <li>Set up a Windows-Based Security program</li>
  <li>Make sure you can control which features of Windows you can limit or disable.</li>
  <li>Make sure it allows for password protection.</li>
  <li>Install Windows Security Policies using Policy Editor (see Appendix)</li>
  <li> Install an encrypted filesystem program. (i.e., CryptDisk)</li>
  <li>This will prevent access to the computer and files on the hard disk unless 
    the password is entered. It will render your data unaccessible even if the 
    hard disk is extracted from the system.</li>
  <li>Delete the following DOS programs (or move them to a floppy):<br>
    FORMAT<br>
    DELTREE<br>
    SUBST<br>
    JOIN<br>
    BACKUP<br>
    RESTORE<br>
    ATTRIB<br>
    MODE</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
  <b><font size="3"><a name="36"></a>Passwords</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Passwords are generally the weakest link in the security chain. When choosing 
  a password, remember these tips:</p>
<p>Do NOT choose something obvious: Swear words, your birthdate, topics pertaining 
  to what you do and/or your interests are are examples of BAD passwords.</p>
<p>A Good Password is one that is totally random. To pick a password, try this: 
  Grab a dictionary. Close your eyes, and flip to a random page. With your eyes 
  still closed, put your finger on a random spot on this page. Remember the word, 
  and do this again. Combine the two words, and append a three-digit number to 
  the end. You also might want to intersperse non-alphanumeric characters into 
  the password in random ways, such as an odd dash or apostrophe here and there.</p>
<p>Also, NEVER write your password down. Always keep it in your head. A simple 
  Post-It note on your monitor can bring down all the security that you so meticulously 
  set up!</p>
<p>A good password system hides the passwords from everyone, including the system 
  administrators. This means that the sys admins cannot tell if the users are 
  putting in weak passwords.</p>
<p>One final note: When designing a security system, be sure to take the user 
  into account. If a system is of such high-grade security that it is a nuisance 
  to use, people will always find the lazy way to do it. (Post-it Notes...)<br>
