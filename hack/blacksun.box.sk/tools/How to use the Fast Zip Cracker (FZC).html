  What is FZC? FZC is a program that cracks zip files (zip is a method of compressing 
  multiple files into one smaller file) that are password-protected (which means 
  you're gonna need a password to open the zip file and extract files out of it). 
  You can get it anywhere - just use a search engine such as altavista.com.<br>
  FZC uses multiple methods of cracking - bruteforce (guessing passwords systematically 
  until the program gets it) or wordlist attacks (otherwise known as dictionary 
  attacks. Instead of just guessing passwords systematically, the program takes 
  passwords out of a &quot;wordlist&quot;, which is a text file that contains 
  possible passwords. You can get lots of wordlists at www.theargon.com. Thanks 
  to Caboom for this tip).<br>
  FZC can be used in order to achieve two different goals: you can either use 
  it to recover a lost zip password which you used to remember but somehow forgot, 
  or to crack zip passwords which you're not supposed to have. So like every tool, 
  this one can be used for good and for evil.<br>
  The first thing I want to say is that reading this tutorial... is the easy way 
  to learn how to use this program, but after reading this part of how to use 
  the FZC you should go and check the texts that come with that program and read 
  them all. You are also going to see the phrase &quot;check name.txt&quot; often 
  in this text. These files should be in FZC's directory. They contain more information 
  about FZC.<br>
  FZC is a good password recovery tool, because it's very fast and also support 
  resuming so you don't have to keep the computer turned on until you get the 
  password, like it used to be some years ago with older cracking programs. You 
  would probably always get the password unless the password is longer than 32 
  chars (a char is a character, which can be anything - a number, a lowercase 
  or undercase letter or a symbol such as ! or &amp;) because 32 chars is the 
  maximum value that FZC will accept, but it doesn't really matter, because in 
  order to bruteforce a password with 32 chars you'll need to be at least immortal..heehhe.. 
  to see the time that FZC takes with bruteforce just open the Bforce.txt file, 
  which contains such information.<br>
  FZC supports brute-force attacks, as well as wordlist attacks. While brute-force 
  attacks don't require you to have anything, wordlist attacks require you to 
  have wordlists, which you can get from www.theargon.com. There are wordlists 
  in various languages, various topics or just miscellaneous wordlists. The bigger 
  the wordlist is, the more chances you have to crack the password.<br>
  Now that you have a good wordlist, just get FZC working on the locked zip file, 
  grab a drink, lie down and wait... and wait... and wait...and have good thoughts 
  like &quot;In wordlist mode I'm gonna get the password in minutes&quot; or something 
  like this... you start doing all this and remember &quot;Hey this guy started 
  with all this bullshit and didn't say how I can start a wordlist attack!...&quot; 
  So please wait just a little more, read this tutorial 'till the end and you 
  can do all this &quot;bullshit&quot;. :)</p>
<p> We need to keep in mind that are some people might choose some really weird 
  passwords (for example: 'e8t7@$^%*gfh), which are harder to crack and are certainly 
  impossible to crack (unless you have some weird wordlist). If you have a bad 
  luck and you got such a file, having a 200MB list won't help you anymore. Instead, 
  you'll have to use a different type of attack. If you are a person that gives 
  up at the first sign of failure, stop being like that or you won't get anywhere. 
  What you need to do in such a situation is to put aside your sweet xxx MB's 
  list and start using the Brute Force attack.<br>
  If you have some sort of a really fast and new computer and you're afraid that 
  you won't be able to use your computer's power to the fullest because the zip 
  cracker doesn't support this kind of technology, it's your lucky day! FZC has 
  multiple settings for all sorts of hardware, and will automatically select the 
  best method.</p>
<p> Now that we've gone through all the theoretical stuff, let's get to the actual 
  commands.</p>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<b><font size="4">Bruteforce </font></b>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<br>
<p> The command line you'll need to use for using brute force is:</p>
<p> fzc -mb -nzFile.zip -lChr Lenght -cType of chars</p>
<p> Now if you read the bforce.txt that comes with fzc you'll find the description 
  of how works Chr Lenght and the Type of chars, but hey, I'm gonna explain this 
  too. Why not, right?...;) (but remember look at the bforce.txt too)</p>
<p> For Chr Lenght you can use 4 kind of switches...<br>
  <br>
  -&gt; You can use range -&gt; 4-6 :it would brute force from 4 Chr passwors 
  to 6 chr passwords<br>
  -&gt; You can use just one lenght -&gt; 5 :it would just brute force using passwords 
  with 5 chars<br>
  -&gt; You can use also the all number -&gt; 0 :it would start brute forcing 
  from passwords with lenght 0 to lenght 32, even if you are crazy i don't think 
  that you would do this.... if you are thinking in doing this get a live...<br>
  -&gt; You can use the + sign with a number -&gt; 3+ :in this case it would brute 
  force from passwords with lenght 3 to passwords with 32 chars of lenght, almost 
  like the last option...</p>
<p> For the Type of chars we have 5 switches they are:</p>
<p> -&gt; a for using lowercase letters<br>
  -&gt; A for using uppercase letters<br>
  -&gt; ! for using simbols (check the Bforce.txt if you want to see what simbols)<br>
  -&gt; s for using space <br>
  -&gt; 1 for using numbers<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Example:<br>
  If you want to find a password with lowercase and numbers by brute force you 
  would just do something like:<br>
  <br>
  fzc -mb -nzTest.zip -l4-7 -ca1</p>
<p> This would try all combinations from passwords with 4 chars of lenght till 
  7 chars, but just using numbers and lowercase.</p>
<p>*****<br>
  <b><font size="3">hint</font></b><br>
  *****<br>
  <br>
  You should never start the first brute force attack to a file using all the 
  chars switches, first just try lowercase, then uppercase, then uppercase with 
  number then lowercase with numbers, just do like this because you can get lucky 
  and find the password much faster, if this doesn't work just prepare your brain 
  and start with a brute force that would take a lot of time. With a combination 
  like lowercase, uppercase, special chars and numbers. </p>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<b><font size="4">Wordlis</font></b>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p> Like I said in the bottom and like you should be thinking now, the wordlist 
  is the most powerfull mode in this program. Using this mode, you can choose 
  between 3 modes, where each one do some changes to the text that is in the wordlist, 
  I'm not going to say what each mode does to the words, for knowing that just 
  check the file wlist.txt, the only thing I'm going to tell you is that the best 
  mode to get passwords is mode 3, but it takes longer time too.<br>
  To start a wordlist attak you'll do something like.<br>
  <br>
  fzc -mwMode number -nzFile.zip -nwWordlist <br>
  <br>
  Where: </p>
<p> Mode number is 1, 2 or 3 just check wlist.txt to see the changes in each mode. 
  <br>
  File.zip is the filename and Wordlist is the name of the wordlist that you want 
  to use. Remember that if the file or the wordlist isn't in the same directory 
  of FZC you'll need to give the all path.<br>
  <br>
  You can add other switches to that line like -fLine where you define in which 
  line will FZC start reading, and the -lChar Length where it will just be read 
  the words in that char length, the switche works like in bruteforce mode.<br>
  So if you something like <br>
  <br>
  fzc -mw1 -nztest.zip -nwMywordlist.txt -f50 -l9+</p>
<p> FZC would just start reading at line 50 and would just read with length &gt;= 
  to 9.</p>
<p> Example:</p>
<p> If you want to crack a file called myfile.zip using the &quot;theargonlistserver1.txt&quot; 
  wordlist, selecting mode 3, and you wanted FZC to start reading at line 50 you 
  would do:</p>
<p> fzc -mw3 -nzmyfile.zip -nwtheargonlistserver1.txt -f50</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<b><font size="4">Resuming </font></b> 
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p> Other good feature in FZC is that FZC supports resuming. If you need to shutdown 
  your computer and FZC is running you just need to press the ESC key, and fzc 
  will stop. Now if you are using a brute force attack the current status will 
  be saved in a file called resume.fzc but if you are using a wordlist it will 
  say to you in what line it ended (you can find the line in the file fzc.log 
  too). <br>
  To resume the bruteforce attack you just need to do:</p>
<p> fzc -mr <br>
  <br>
  And the bruteforce attack will start from the place where it stopped when you 
  pressed the ESC key.<br>
  But if you want to resume a wordlist attack you'll need to start a new wordlist 
  attack, saying where it's gonna start. So if you ended the attack to the file.zip 
  in line 100 using wordlist.txt in mode 3 to resume you'll type </p>
<p> fzc -mw3 -nzfile.zip -nwwordlist.txt -f100</p>
<p> Doing this FZC would start in line 100, since the others 99 lines where already 
  checked in an earlier FZC session.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Well, it looks like I covered most of what you need to know. I certainly hope 
  it helped you... don't forget to read the files that come with the program, 
  and visit http://blacksun.box.sk for more tutorials. If you have any problem 
  fell free to post your questions on the message board at blacksun.box.sk, but 
  don't send me any files to crack for you! Use your own computer power.</p>
