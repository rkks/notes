<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> hi ppl
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> I am EXtremely sorry for being late
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> should we begin with the lecture
<br>&lt;fatboyjoe> just when everyone had given up hope of seeing it
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yeah ..sorry man
<br>&lt;fatboyjoe> heh
<br>&lt;fatboyjoe> oh well
<br>&lt;fatboyjoe> better late than never I guess :)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> K..is everyone eager and attentive
<br>&lt;pitpat> oh
<br>&lt;pitpat> yea
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> hehe
<br>&lt;pitpat> i'm all ears
<br>&lt;pitpat> finally
<br>&lt;pitpat> ;O)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> lol
<br>&lt;Yodason> =)
<br>&lt;pitpat> ok bits
<br>&lt;pitpat> are you doing it on perl?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> k..the connection here in India is haywire t'day
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and hence the delay
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yeah..i'd like to know if there r total newbies too
<br>&lt;pitpat> &lt;--- newbie of perl
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i mean those who are absolutely oblivious to the existence
of perl and its basics

<br>*** _ciR_ has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<br>&lt;Getalife> Any phreakers around?
<br>&lt;pitpat> &lt;--- not that much of a newbie
<br>&lt;pitpat> hehe
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> hmm good then
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> what i am about to share with you t'day is the relation
of perl and the web
<br>&lt;pitpat> cgi
<br>&lt;pitpat> common gateway interface
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> PRECISELY
<br>&lt;pitpat> ;O)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> hmm i have got a learned audience .. i must say
<br>*** wascy|prepare_hack is now known as wascy
<br>&lt;pitpat> go on...
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> when we talk of cgi..
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> we are talking about dynamic information
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and interactivity
<br>&lt;pitpat> server-side
<br>&lt;pitpat> web
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yess.. that is what makes the web so ALIVE
<br>*** jacs has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> Perl very much like other languages
<br>&lt;pitpat> doesn't need to be compiled
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> supports the concept of modularity
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> ok.. that too (very basic tho) ;)
<br>*** wascy has quit IRC (Quit: )
<br>*** jacs has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> all modules are available today on Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> for Perl and CGI to&nbsp; be integrated we need the
cgi.pm module
<br>&lt;Getalife> Any phreakers around?
<br>*** fatboyjoe has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> that has to be included in our pel script
<br>*** _ciR_ has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;pitpat> ciR
<br>&lt;pitpat> i found the lecturer
<br>&lt;_ciR_> who
<br>&lt;pitpat> bitsNbytes
<br>*** demontanus has quit IRC (Quit: Math is like sex. Add the people,
subtract the clothes, divide the legs, and multiply.)
<br>&lt;pitpat> hehe
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> let us begin with a sample basic program
<br>&lt;_ciR_> hehe
<br>&lt;pitpat> don't do the hello world plz
<br>&lt;pitpat> :O(
<br>&lt;_ciR_> looks like bsrf ous u
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> nah don't worry
<br>&lt;pitpat> can you go a bit faster bits?
<br>&lt;pitpat> i'm getting sleepy
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i am trying
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> but the network connection seems to be outof order
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> #! /usr/bin/perl -w
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> this is the line that acts like a include &lt;> line
in C
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the -w is for warnings on
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> # a program for your type of babe
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> this was a comment

<br>*** freespeachlamer has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;freespeachlamer> is the lecture over?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> we just created a small basic interactive CGI-perl
script that propmts the user for his
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> favorite chick type
<br>*** TCL has joined #bsrf
<br>*** ChanServ sets mode: +v TCL
<br>&lt;freespeachlamer> umm can someone send me a log of the lecture?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> no ... its just begun
<br>&lt;freespeachlamer> oh
<br>&lt;freespeachlamer> sorry :)
<br>&lt;rek> bitsNbytes: your a little late
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> now if we don't wanna type all that HTML stuff
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> OK .. so what do u sugget "rek"
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i mean suggest
<br>&lt;rek> what u mean?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yeah .. i know i am late .....??
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> as long as there are a pair of attentive ears .. it's
ok
<br>&lt;rek> well, we had a lot more people, lot of us left @ 1:30...
<br>&lt;rek> i was just makin sure u know.. go on with the lecture
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yeah .. iknow and i am sorry (for the umpteenth time
now)
<br>*** jacs has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> ok lemme ask how many of us are familiar with basic
unix concepts and cgi scripting
<br>&lt;Yodason> not me =p
<br>*** jacs has joined #bsrf
<br>* rek is
<br>* fatboyjoe is
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> so i can really move on to REAL stuff
<br>* freespeachlamer is not
<br>&lt;freespeachlamer> but dont worry about me :)
<br>*** freespeachlamer has quit IRC (Quit: )
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> then let us begin with what we really can do
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> k let us see this bit complex program i'vbe written
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> #! /usr/bin/perl -w
<br>*** rek sets mode: +m
<br>*** zwanderer has quit IRC (Quit: bye bye peppe)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> # this program loads the cgi module to decide information
by web server
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> use strict;
<br>&lt;rek> bbl have to leave
<br>*** pitpat has quit IRC (Quit: )
<br>*** rek sets mode: -m
<br>*** rek has quit IRC (Quit: )
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> man .. am i that boring
<br>&lt;Yodason> lol'
<br>&lt;TCL> lol
<br>&lt;sohed> nope, go on
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> # the strict module ensures your code is in order and
within the norms
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> so we write
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> use strict;
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> use CGI qw (:standard escapeHTML);
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> # now to get a parameter from a form
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> my $value=param ('PARAM_NAME');
<br>*** Getalife has quit IRC (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> # and output a document
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> print header(), start_html("Howdy there!"),
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> p("U typed: ", tt(escapeHTML($value))),
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> end_html
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> some explanation now
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> CGI scripts are called in two main ways
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> referred to as "methods" --> not HTTP methods
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> one is the procedural method.. the other is object
oriented
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> procedural for simple tasks
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and object oriented for complex ones
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> our little program here can be analyzed as follows
<br>*** X has joined #bsrf
<br>*** DigitalFallout has quit IRC (Read error: 104 (Connection reset
by peer))
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> as u might have guessed $anything stands for variable
declaration in perl
<br>&lt;X> meaw
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> perl supports all kinds of data types
<br>*** essex has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> collectively called as "scalar variables"
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> u no longer have to specify a "type"
<br>&lt;essex> Hi ya
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> u just say $whatever = somevalue
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the "my" reserved word makes that particular variable
or parameter
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> passed to a subroutine "local" to ur specific program
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i.e. "my" for locality of reference ..ok
<br>* essex want's to know if anyone knows a good VB decompiler
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the header() returns a string content type
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> followed by the start_html
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> which returns the string, passed as parameter ,
<br>*** phil has quit IRC (Remote closed the connection)
<br>*** TCL has quit IRC (Quit: BBL)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> ok.. now how do we use this program
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i hope whatever i said was not too obvious
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> anywayz
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i shall tell u how to get this prog running under UNIX
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> since I have very lil knowledge bout windowz
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> generally we place this program on a web server (running
APACHE preferrably)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> path-> /home/httpd/cgi-bin/program
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> where program is the program name
<br>*** josh-hamster has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and then use a browser lynx (for the console) Netscape,
Amaya (for Xwin)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> get the program running
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> am i .. making any sense to u ppl
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> feedbacks plz
<br>&lt;HardW1r3> yeh
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> yes
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> OKay!
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> :)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> some of you might be wondering why the HELL use Perl
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> there are many reasons ..out of which some are
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> PERL -->Practical&nbsp; Extract Report Language-->
created by Larry Wall
<br>*** BootError has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> is one of the most Powerful Scripting language on earth
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> apart from being a scripting language .. it also incorpaorates
the best of C and C++
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> thus in short PERL is a superset of scripting lang,
C and C++
<br>*** [PhaLanX] has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;suspect> Who was the only guy to get his work done by Friday ?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the creator and other contributors have now&nbsp; thought
of bringing this power to the Web
<br>&lt;suspect> eh ?
<br>*** ^CoaXiaL^ has quit IRC (Quit: )
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> suspect: something important ....?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i guess not
<br>* NIN_Dude slaps suspect around a bit with a large trout
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> so let us move on to error handling
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> supposing u have trouble tracking down you scripts
warnings
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and error mesages, or your scripts STDERR output is
confusing you
<br>*** kamm has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> we use the CGI::Carp module
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> it is easy to understand if u know C++
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> it is analogous to using a class called CGI
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and the "carp" portion of it
<br>*** essex has quit IRC (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i will now create a small prototype
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> to redirect errors to files of your choice
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> BEGIN
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> {
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i wonder why nobody has any doubts

in ancient phoenetix
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> anywaz
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> BEGIN
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> {
<br>&lt;HardW1r3> im listening
<br>&lt;sohed> me too
<br>* NIN_Dude raises his hand
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> use CGI::Carp qw(carpout);
<br>*** X is now known as Pr0nKing
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yes
<br>*** Pr0nKing is now known as P0rnKing
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> NIN_Dude:........?
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> um.. BEGIN?
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> as in class?
<br>*** fatboyjoe has left #bsrf
<br>* NIN_Dude cries
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yes exactly
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> oh aight
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> notice the "qw" i am using frequently
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> it stands for quote words and is a wonderful lil reserved
word
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> OK .. lemme switch back to basics and discuss a small
simple perl program to
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> make things more clearer
<br>*** [PhaLanX] has quit IRC (Quit: )
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> #! usr/bin/perl -w

<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> parsin?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> coming .. to it
<br>*** Kamikaze has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> what is an stdin, stdout, and stderr?
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> ok
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> standard
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> input
<br>* NIN_Dude shuts up
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> aye...........
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> chomp cuts out the newline character
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> not really much help but thanks anyway
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the entire string is taken along with the newline char
also a part of it
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> so u need to cut it off
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> oh I see the tutorial is underway, sorry for interrupting
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> there is a function called "chop" also
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> does chomp cut off the last char or just the newline?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> good question NIN
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> chop does cut off the last char
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> but not ole chomp
<br>&lt;HardW1r3> dammit this sounds like school
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> lol
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> it just does away with the&nbsp; \n
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> hehe
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> is it clear ;)
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> really sorry for interrupting here but have you covered
website redirection yet?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i have covered basic perl-cgi script and error redirection
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> yeah yeah I know everyones gonna /ignore kamikaze :)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and will come to that just in a few moments
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> actually i have a hell lot to say
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> and very lil time i suppose
<br>*** P0rnKing is now known as X
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> how long do the lectures go on usually
<br>* Kamikaze shuts up and listens up
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> this is the first time i am delivering one
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> as long as it takes till ppl are satisfactory
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> satisfied^
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> k..fine
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> so is the basic structire of a perl prog clear
<br>&lt;sohed> yes
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> nope I missed it :)
<br>*** s4m1k has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> then i revert back to the main topic of discussion
<br>* Kamikaze will really shutup now... promise
<br>*** ExposedTruth has quit IRC (Quit: )
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> now back to CGI_Perl
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> man the connection here in India sux
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> it is crawling
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> let us have a nice Graphical Interactivity
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> I'm now reading 'Teach yourself C in 21 days'
<br>*** fatboyjoe has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> hmm
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> oops wrong chan
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> shite
<br>*** s4m1k has quit IRC (Quit: [x]chat)
<br>&lt;Kamikaze> it's best if I leave
<br>*** Kamikaze has left #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> any doubts so far
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> any damn doubt that may be troubling anyone
<br>&lt;NIN_Dude> what if it's not running UNIX?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> then anyway u have to find a way to get ur program
on the server
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the web server..in the right location
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the right path i mean
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i am not familiar with the procedure for windowz tho
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> only when it is on the server .. can ur&nbsp; script
be of any use
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i have told .. how to get it running on UNIX
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> ok .. comin to where I left
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the function for redirecting error messages
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> u have to try this&nbsp; .. code and learn
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> coz i have made it rigfht now
<br>*** fatboyjoe has left #bsrf
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> so .. u get my point...;)

<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> the carpout parameter is to carp-out or blurt out warnings
or error returns
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> die is like exit()

<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> Even if the error occurs before u get the HTTP header
out

dreaded "500 server error"
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> how many of u r on a *NIX box
<br>&lt;sohed> now?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yeah
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> or maybe do use a nix box freq.
<br>*** snider has joined #bsrf
<br>*** ChanServ sets mode: +o snider
<br>&lt;sohed> i use it frequently but not right now
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> anyway .. even after taking care of errors if you happen
to get the 500 server error
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> it means two things
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> on a Unix system either you dont have the right permissions
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> u can check that with the ls -l and assign the script
(on the server of course) a 0755 pemission
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> 0755 if u owned it
<br>*** Satori has joined #bsrf

<br>&lt;Dustin> the docs in one place say to use 2.7.2.3 to compile 2.4.6
<br>&lt;Dustin> in another it says NOT to use it
<br>&lt;Dustin> what gcc version do i need?
<br>&lt;Dustin> 2.7.2.3 or 2.91.66 ?
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> tho not necessary some servers identify the ext also
<br>*** suspect has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> Dustin: The latest
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> in ur case 2.7 will do
<br>&lt;Dustin> i compiled a while ago with 2.96. something and got lots
of errors
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> i maean 2.7.2.3
<br>&lt;Dustin> ok
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> wht errors
<br>&lt;Dustin> even though it says "*gcc 2.7.2.3 is no longer supportes*"
<br>&lt;Dustin> uhm,
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> yeah module and version dependencies are quite annoying
and can be solved best by trial and error
<br>*** zwanderer has joined #bsrf
<br>&lt;Dustin> let me rephrase it: it complied badly
<br>&lt;Dustin> x wouldnt start, lots of cryptic x errors
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> heheh i know it happens
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> anyway.. we are here for something else
<br>&lt;bitsNbytes> a lecture is in progress
