<p>&lt;Forbze>	lol
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok im back</b>
<br>&lt;AZTEK>	well now loging works
<br>&lt;AZTEK>	i am loging simprix
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	anyone can butt in if they want or if i say something wrong</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	everyone here</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	;]
<br>&lt;Strider>	ya
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok girls and boys</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	Ok this will be centralized around linux because I have never done this in Windows and Windows sucks</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	oki
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	one thing i do know if you want to do this in windows then you need to use netstumpler</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	or ApSniff
<br>&lt;miteymous>	from a website i am lookin at :/
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	Ok first off in linux you need to recompile your kernel with netlink and get rid of pcmcia support in the kernel</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	then you have to get the pcmcia source for pcmcia-cd.sourceforge.net</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	there are to ways you can do it now</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	you can use the wireless extensions in the kernel but you need a good card like a cisco aironet card</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	but the wireless extensions does not have as good sniffing techniques as the linux-wlan source</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	so they way i have done it is using the linux-wlan-ng source</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	you can get that from www.linux-wlan.org and you need to compile that</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	any questions so far?</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	or is no one listening</b>
<br>&lt;Strider>	nope
<br>&lt;miteymous>	is there info on editing the kernel?
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	have you recompiled a kernel before?</b>
<br>&lt;Strider>	miteymouse, wheres that site with ApSniff?
<br>&lt;miteymous>	no im new sorry :(
<br>&lt;miteymous>	strider: www.wardriving.com
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	What he/she/it said^
<br>&lt;Strider>	thnx
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok well you should read the howto </b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	i plan on it :P
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok once you have compiled all that stuff your almost ready to get started</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Could you just explain what it is that those modifications do?
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Or is it too lenghty to explain now.
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	oh yea the linux-wlan stuff only works with the prism2 chipset, which are cards like linksys, dlink, netgear, zoom alot of consumer cards</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	what motifications</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	The recompilations
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	they are pretty much drivers for the cards</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	i prefer the zoom wireless cards</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Ah, ty
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok does everyone in here know what snmp is</b>
<br>&lt;Forbze>	any aussies here>?
<br>&lt;Forbze>	SNMP
<br><font color="red">*	Paranoiac does not....is a know-nothing-newb</font>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	well the linux-wlan binaries are alot like using snmp</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	like to specify the ssid</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	a ssid is kinda like a network id </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	say one access point is on ssid: ap01 </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and one access point is on ssid: ap02</b>
<br><font color="red">---	BaGeL[CS] is now known as BaGeL</font>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and you want to attach to ap01 then you would use the ssid of ap01</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	it is two specify wireless networks</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	everyone with me?</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and questions?</b>
<br>&lt;Forbze>	SNMP - Simple Network Managment Protocol
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ep</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yep</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Ah
<br>&lt;Forbze>	http://www.rad.com/networks/1995/snmp/snmp.htm
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Ty
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok but if you are not familer with snmp and using mibs, you could use a program my friend wrote called wlanfe you can get it from se.rious.net or freshmeat.net</b>

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	i am warning, make sure you are with someone else and make them drive</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Hehe
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	it is really hard to drive and look at your computer at the same time trust me</b>
<br>&lt;Forbze>	wtf?
<br>&lt;Forbze>	drive?
<br>&lt;Forbze>	and computer
<br>&lt;Strider>	heh
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	also you should get some programs before you go </b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	so you basically can just use someone elses wireless network?
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	these programs are kismet, airsnort, scanchan, arpping</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes miteymous</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	like...hijack it...an invisible parasite?
<br>&lt;miteymous>	ok question
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes</b>
<br><font color="red">--	Sheik has quit (Quit: )</font>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	would it be possible to set up your own wireless network, that hijacks your targets, and then spreads it farther via your equipment
<br>&lt;miteymous>	maybe letting you have free access at your house
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes you could bridge the connection</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	with a wireless bridge</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	he networks would need to overlap, though
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	*The
<br>&lt;miteymous>	would the same basic techniques work with cell phone modems
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	well if you have the wireless bridge on the same ssid then your ok</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and they wont overlap</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	miteymous: i dont know anything about cell phone modems</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	well i mean they obviously work on different frequencies
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	it might work but i dont know what cell phones use as there protocals</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	well then you could use a frequency counter and use a ham radio</b>

<br><font color="red">---	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Forbze</font>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok well when you are ready to go you need to put your wireless card in promiscuos mode which means it will gather everything that is in the air </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	there are tools that come with kismet</b>
<br><font color="red">--	LiquidKn0wledge (LiquidKn0w@66.153.12.78) has left #bsrf</font>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok after that is all set you will start up kismet</b>

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	once something pops up on the screen there will be three sections</b>
<br>&lt;zemo>	nite all
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ssid: it will say the ssid here</b>
<br>&lt;Strider>	nite
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	WEP: it will say if wep is being used</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	channel it will say what channel the network is on </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	does everyone know what WEP is</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	no

<br><font color="red">--	ro0t has quit (Quit: rm -rf /;reboot&)</font>

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	while you are watching a kismet it will say what the ssid is remember that</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	if it says under W: N, then they arent using wep</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok so once you have got these</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	you will need pop out your card to take it out of promiscues mode </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and pop it back in</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	then you will open wlanfe</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and under ssid type the ssid you got from kismet</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and click apply</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	now you are attached </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	now you need to get a ip </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	if the access point is using dhcp you can get it that way</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	but if it isnt you need to find out what ips they are using</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	to do this we will use arping </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	run that and we will get some ips they are using </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	so you will assign a unused ip using ifconfig</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	and then it is just like you are on a normal network</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	any questions?</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	so at this point you are connected and have internet access?
<br>&lt;Strider>	huh? is this thing still going??
<br>&lt;miteymous>	and access to their network?
<br>&lt;Strider>	j/k
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Hehe
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	what Strider are you bored</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	whoah
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Are there many networks that are unsecured?
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes</b>

<br>&lt;Strider>	danece?
<br>&lt;Strider>	dance*
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	How can you secure yourself from being detected/accessed?

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes</b>

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	well out in california two kids figured out how to break wep</b>
<br>&lt;Strider>	hold on, whats wep?? is that still the wireless thingy?
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes</b>
<br>&lt;Strider>	ah ok
<br>&lt;Strider>	carry on
<br>&lt;miteymous>	wireless encryption protocol :x
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	it is wireless encryption protocal</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok when you find a wireless network you need to use airsnort</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	with your card still in promiscuos mode you need to start airsnort and just start to gather packets </b>

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	then it will list the wep key </b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	everyone with me so far</b>

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes miteymous</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	That's useful
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yes</b>
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	ok so once you have the wep key</b>
<br>&lt;Paranoiac>	Is the WEP verification a constant activity then? As opposed to using it once, like a password....
<br><font color="red">-->	nosolution (NS@p19-tnt1.ham.ihug.co.nz) has joined #bsrf</font>

<br><b>&lt;simprix>	802.11a, 802.11g are supposed to be better</b>
<br>&lt;miteymous>	but you said earlier you could bridge it, so itd be possible to get within say 100 feet, bridge the connection to a landline that went back to your house?
<br><b>&lt;simprix>	yea you could do that </b>
