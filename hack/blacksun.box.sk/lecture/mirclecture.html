<P>&lt;reptile> ok lets start
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> :)
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> o well
<BR>&lt;reptile> So u just got Mirc ur thinking damn this client sucks
i wish i could switch to xchat
<BR>&lt;reptile> (well u can xchat is there for iwndows also u know)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> so mirc scripting?
<BR>&lt;reptile> yeah
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> -------------MIRC SCRIPTING LECTURE------------------
<BR>&lt;reptile> but anyways
<BR>&lt;reptile> there are a few + points to mirc
<BR>&lt;reptile> theres a built in scriptin language!
<BR>&lt;reptile> Now u wanna ask the basic question
<BR>*** idiocy|idle has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> What is mIRC scripting? mIRC scripting is a very powerful
way of customising mIRC. It allows you to control the way in which it does
things. Scripting is similar to programming, but I would say its easier
to pick up because there are so many built in functions. Scripting is mainly
used as a way to perform lots of commands with little effort. now what
exactly makes a script? Commands - General commands like /join /part etc
Aliases - Groups of Commands Po
<BR>&lt;reptile> that was huge
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>&lt;reptile> lucky i typed this out
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> kewl
<BR>*** BaGeL has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> now ill take a 2 second break to allow u to read through
that
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> hehe
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> already did
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ;)
<BR>&lt;reptile> done
<BR>&lt;reptile> now lets go on
<BR>&lt;reptile> lets start with Aliases
<BR>*** ICE-T has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> What is an Alias? An alias is simply a collection of commands
<BR>*** _ciR_ has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>*** piksel has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> Any command you use in the edit box of a window which
starts with a / can be used in an alias. To edit aliases press alt + A
in mIRC or goto Tools>Aliases, this will bring up the alias editing window.
<BR>&lt;reptile> Alias are written in this format: /aliasname command |
command The /aliasname is what you will type in the normal edit box when
chatting (cannot have spaces).
<BR>*** piksel is now known as _piksel-
<BR>*** {LG} has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> Try to give it a meaningful name, so it is easier to rememeber
what it does. The command is a command such as /join (you dont need the
/ in an alias).
<BR>*** _piksel- has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> j #bread5
<BR>*** {LG} has left #bsrf
<BR>*** rabonne has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> lol
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> lol
<BR>* freakOVER is typing...
<BR>* freakOVER click click
<BR>&lt;reptile> The | breaks up the commands, so mIRC knows what to do.
<BR>&lt;reptile> u can use 2 commands on the same line usin the |
<BR>&lt;reptile> 0_0 WHAT A WONDER
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> can u use more than one?
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> yup
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> i mean
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> more than 2
<BR>&lt;reptile> lol sure
<BR>*** piksel has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>*** rabonne is now known as _rabonne-
<BR>&lt;reptile> u can use as many as u can
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> oh ok
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> whew...
<BR>&lt;reptile> now heres a example
<BR>&lt;reptile>&nbsp; Echo a message to the current window /Echo is a
mIRC command to show text in a window, only you can see it. Format: /echo
text Alias Code: /e echo This is echod to the current window. Usage: type
/e in a window to display the message.
<BR>*** Lone[Star] has quit IRC (Quit: I've learned so much but at the
end I've learn so little... knowledge never ends... - Lone[Star])
<BR>&lt;reptile> thats juz a simple example
<BR>&lt;reptile> aliases can be used for much more difficult things
<BR>&lt;reptile> not exactly difficult
<BR>&lt;reptile> i mean time consuming
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> hehe
<BR>&lt;reptile> Joining a channel /Join is a command which joins a channel.
Format: /join channelname Alias Code: /j join #hex Usage: type /j in a
window to join #hex
<BR>*** _acid519- has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** MASTURB4TION has joined #bsrf

<BR>&lt;reptile> Performing an action /me is a command which performs an
action on a channel/nick. Format: /me action Alias Code: /happy me is so
happy cos, s/he can make an alias! Usage: type /happy in a channel window
to perform the action Aliases can also be put on multiple lines, making
them easier to read. This is done using the curly brackets ({ and }). The
{ basically says to mIRC "code start" The } basically says to mIRC "code
end" For every { you have you must
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +v [PhaLanX]
<BR>&lt;reptile> Multiple lines in an Alias Here we'll make the Join 2
Channels alias multi line. Notice how each command is on a seperate line,
and there are no |. A new line is the same as a |. Alias Code: /tjoin2
{ join #hex join #bsrf } Usage: type /tjoin2 in a window to join #hex and
#bsrf Try making a few of your own and then we'll move onto popups.
<BR>*** _acid519- has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> side note:
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> aliases can be made using the /alias command
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> ex: /alias happy /me is happy
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> this will create the /happy command
<BR>&lt;reptile> tankies [PhaLanX]
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> no prob

<BR>&lt;reptile> What is a Popup? Popups are custom menus. To edit popups
press alt + P in mIRC or Tools>Popups, this will bring up the popup editing
window. Popups are generally used as a quick way to perform an alias (Remember
an alias is a group of commands). Popups appear in order on the menu in
the same order they are written. Popups are written in this format: Popupname:command
| command The Popupname is what will appear on the menu (Can have spaces).
The command
<BR>&lt;reptile> heres a example Performing an action using a popup In
the channel popup editing window (on the menu: view...channel in the popup
editing window) put the code. Popup Code: Happy: me is so happy cos, s/he
can make a popup! Usage: right click in a channel window and select "Happy"
to perform the action
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> The command
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> &lt;reptile> heres
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ?
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> u missed stuff didn't u?
<BR>&lt;reptile> no its juz ur lag
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>&lt;reptile> The command is a command such as /join the same as an
alias.
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> o ok
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> lag
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> bah!
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> :)
<BR>&lt;reptile> Using a popup to run an alias Here we will use a popup
to run the alias we made in Example 4 Popup Code: Happy2:tme Usage: right
click in a channel window and select "Happy2" to perform the action
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> side note, to make items under a menu, you use periods
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> ex:
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> Happy
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> .Happy1:/happy1
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> .Happy2:/happy1
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> that would create Happy in the menu with items happy1
and happy2
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> the parent cannot have a command (Happy doesnt have
a command, yet happy1 and happy2 do)

<BR>&lt;freakOVER> :)
<BR>&lt;reptile> Telling a channel about yourself Here we will use a popup
to tell a channel about yourself. (Change the information to suit yourself)
Notice the return of multiple lines. Popup Code: About me:{ me is male,
14 yrs of age, from India } Usage: right click in a channel window and
select "About me" to tell the channel about yourself on 3 lines. Ok try
a few of your own, then we'll move onto identifiers. What is an Identifier?
An identifier is a command which
<BR>&lt;reptile> about this later. So $1 would be the first parameter,
$2 the second and so on. To list all the parameters use an - after the
$1 e.g $1- would mean all parameters, $2- would mean all parameters after
parameter 1 ($1).

<BR>&lt;freakOVER> What is an Identifier? An identifier is a command which
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> &lt;reptile> about this later.
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> :(
<BR>*** idiocy|idle has quit IRC (Not enough time connected)
<BR>&lt;reptile> k ill type that aprt again
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> tnx
<BR>&lt;reptile> ]returns a value. All identifiers start with a $ character.
One of the most commonly used identifiers is $me. It returns your current
nickname. To use an identifier in an alias you just put its name and mIRC
will replace it with the applicable value when the alias is run. Identifiers
with just a number such as $1 return the parameters passed to the alias/popup.
For an alias its anything you type after the /aliasname in the window.
For a popup it depends
<BR>*** k1mus4b1 has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> So $1 would be the first parameter, $2 the second and
so on. To list all the parameters use an - after the $1 e.g $1- would mean
all parameters, $2- would mean all parameters after parameter 1 ($1).
<BR>*** N has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> Using the $me identifier $me will be replaced by your
nickname. Alias Code: /whoami echo You current nickname is $me Usage: Type
/whoami in a window to see your current nickname.
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> side note: in popups, the nicklist specifically, $1
$2 etc are the selections
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> therefore if the popup is:
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> Happy:/me is happy and $1 too
<BR>*** k1mus4b1 has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> $1 would be the first nick selected
<BR>&lt;reptile> Using the $# identifier $1- will be replaced by all parameters
from $1 onwards. Alias Code: /saythis echo You typed $1- Usage: Type /saythis
I can use identifiers! in a window to see the message.

<BR>&lt;reptile> What is a Remote Event? A remote event is one which happens
when a certain event occurs, such as when someone joins a channel. This
is where identifiers are used a lot. Press alt + R or Tools>Remotes to
open the remote event edit window. Events are written in this format: on
1:event: Things after the : depends on the event. But at the end you use,
commands and alises.

<BR>*** SySt3mShk has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> events are the hardest thing to grasp in mirc scripting
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> they can create really complex scripts
<BR>&lt;reptile> like hexbot
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> and, remotes are powerful enuff to generate aliases
and popups (ask later)
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>&lt;reptile> The join event. This triggers when someone joins a channel
you are on. $nick returns to the nick of the user who joined. $chan returns
to the channel they joined. # means the event will occur for every channel.
You can specify a specific channel such as #mIRC though. Alias Code: on
1:JOIN:#:echo $nick just came into $chan Effect: Now when someone joins
a channel, a message will be shown in the active window.

<BR>&lt;reptile> The text event. This triggers when someone says something
on a channel you are on. $nick returns to the nick of the user who said
something. $chan returns to the channel they said it on. # means the event
will occur for every channel. You can specify a specific channel such as
#mIRC though. Alias Code: on 1:TEXT:hello *:#:msg $chan $nick $+ : $+ hi
Effect: Now when someone says "hello" at the start of the sentance it will
message the chan saying hi Ok t
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> note: for a full lists of all events, check thr remotes
scripts section in mirc.hlp

<BR>&lt;reptile> Storing someones name. The $?= is an identifier which
asks the user for input. %name would be set to whatever they type in. Alias
Code: /getname set %name $?="Enter name:" Usage: type /getname
<BR>&lt;reptile> Storing someones name, then showing it. Alias Code: /getname2
{ set %name $?="Enter name:" echo Your name is: %name } Usage: type /getname2
So with what we know of variables we can: Set a variable return a variable
value Clear a variable Lets put it all in one alias
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> wow u type fast

<BR>&lt;reptile> Storing variable, showing it, and then unsetting it. Alias
Code: /getname3 { set %name $?="Enter name:" echo Your name is: %name unset
%name } Usage: type /getname3 Were getting to know quite a lot now, soon
we'll be making more complex aliases and remotes. Ok try a few of your
own, then we'll move onto Basic Commands. Basic Commands: What are the
basic commands used? This section is list of basic commands which you wouldnt
often use outside a script. S
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> thats what variables are in mIRC
<BR>&lt;reptile> that shoudl be all

<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> their syntax is: /set %varname value

<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> let me take over for a while
<BR>&lt;reptile> just one more thing
<BR>&lt;[PhaLanX]> have a few things to add
<BR>&lt;reptile> Using goto's The goto command tells mIRC to "jump" to
a specific point in your script (known as a label), bypassing anything
inbetween. A label looks like this: :LabelName Its useful when you want
to repeat a section of code a few times. You generally have to use an If-Then-Else
statment when using a goto. Heres a simple example, which has no real use.
Alias Code: /tgoto { goto skip echo This will never happen! :skip echo
The command above will never be
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ahh!
<BR>&lt;reptile> np
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> too much stuff!
<BR>* freakOVER is cramming
<BR>&lt;reptile> Any questions?
<BR>&lt;reptile> The VB lecture will be next week
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> cool
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> i think i might enjoy that better
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> :)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay so ----------END OF LECTURE-----------
