<P>&lt;blitz> led raymon talk
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> so you learned c++
<BR>&lt;Raymond> so i learned alot about the graphical functions in the
gdi32.dll
<BR>&lt;Raymond> and then i learned C++
<BR>&lt;Raymond> one of the most powerfull functions in gdi32 is BitBlt
or StrechBlt
<BR>&lt;Raymond> most C++ windows prgramers have used it
<BR>&lt;ArSeNiC> i wanna learn c++ ray, Any advice fer me?
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> keep quiet arsenic
<BR>&lt;Raymond> yes, think very structured
<BR>&lt;Raymond> =)
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> read alot
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> lecture
<BR>&lt;blitz> LET RAY TALK THEN QUESTIONS
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Lecture seriously begins approx. here --
<BR>&lt;Raymond> what BitBlt and stretchblt do
<BR>&lt;Raymond> is copy rectangkles of image data to other Device Contexts
<BR>*** rek has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: +o rek
<BR>&lt;Raymond> this can be the basis for bitmaped image output
<BR>*** snider sets mode: +v Raymond
<BR>*** rek is now known as rek[away]
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> then what?
<BR>&lt;blitz> ?
<BR>&lt;Raymond> while bitblt is considerd a fast function
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> what include do we need for BitBlt and stretchblt?
<BR>&lt;Raymond> it can become very slow when not used in an acceptable
fashion
<BR>*** Skulker has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond> btiblt and stretchblt can be accesed thru win32 by the
windows.h
<BR>&lt;Raymond> and should not require and lib inclusion
<BR>&lt;ArSeNiC> hey, why aint you nice 2 newbies to your server
<BR>&lt;Raymond> now, to get back to the begining on windows and graphics
<BR>&lt;ArSeNiC> just cause i dont know c/c++ doesnt mean i dunno unix
syntax
<BR>&lt;Raymond> windows by nature is slow graphicly
<BR>&lt;Raymond> but widnows has many ways to exploit fast image routines
<BR>&lt;Raymond> oen feature is the windows DIB object
<BR>&lt;Raymond> it stands for Device Indipendant Bitmap
<BR>*** rxcv has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond> and it simply stores logical image data in ram
<BR>&lt;Raymond> not in video memeory
<BR>* pitpat- nods
<BR>&lt;Raymond> this is a very important feature
<BR>&lt;Raymond> becsaue yuo can aquire a pointer to the image data's bytes
<BR>*** rxcv Quit (Not enough time connected)
<BR>*** DeadKro1 has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond> and do extreamly fast image manipultions with that pointer
<BR>*** rxcv&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond> this can be as simple as ploting pixels
<BR>*** DHamster&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond> or as complex as drawing an overlayed sine wave on an
image to produce the effect of water
<BR>&lt;devin> Does anyone know the PHP header function to that'll seamlessly
change URL's?
<BR>&lt;devin> I can't find it.
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> shhhh devin
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> lecture
<BR>&lt;DHamster> hiwo all agian
<BR>&lt;Raymond> im now going to ask everyone if they have a certain direction
they would like me to go with this lecture
<BR>&lt;Raymond> be it game specific
<BR>&lt;blitz> please continute ray
<BR>&lt;Raymond> or multimedia specific
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> multimedia ray
<BR>*** DHamster is now known as _Dhamster-
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> show us a little coding
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> game?
<BR>&lt;Raymond> is that hunanomous?
<BR>&lt;Mtcx> game
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> ok game
<BR>&lt;Raymond> ok game it is
<BR>*** devin has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond> i will now shwo you a fucntion that i use for extramly
fast pixel manipulation
<BR>&lt;Raymond> please wait...
<BR>* pitpat- holds
<BR>&lt;Raymond> ok, sorry for the wait
<BR>&lt;Raymond> void __forceinline WritePixel(signed long x,signed long
y,FC_Image *lpImage,FS_Color *lpColor)
<BR>&lt;Raymond> {
<BR>&lt;Raymond>&nbsp; if(x>-1&amp;&amp;y>-1&amp;&amp;x&lt;lpImage->ImageWidth&amp;&amp;y&lt;lpImage->ImageHeight)
<BR>&lt;Raymond>&nbsp; {
<BR>&lt;Raymond>&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned char *lpByte=(unsigned char*)&amp;lpImage->lpImagePixels[y*lpImage->ImageWidth+x];

<BR>&lt;Raymond>&nbsp;&nbsp; *lpByte=lpColor->R;
<BR>&lt;Raymond>&nbsp; }
<BR>&lt;Raymond> }
<BR>&lt;Raymond> this function writes a single 24 bit color pointer into
an existing image
<BR>&lt;rek[away]> Raymond: try pvting it to him next time (chan flood...)
<BR>&lt;snider> rek
<BR>&lt;snider> its a lecture
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> it's lecture
<BR>&lt;rek[away]> opps
<BR>&lt;Raymond> the advantage of using this fucntion over the well known
function SetPixel
<BR>&lt;Raymond> is that is is extramly fast in comparison
<BR>&lt;Raymond> SetPixel does alot of color table matching in the background
<BR>&lt;ElfQrin> hehe... luckily rek didn't kicked Raymond as a warning
;)
<BR>&lt;Raymond> and simply will not do for graphical manipulation
<BR>&lt;Raymond> hehe
<BR>&lt;Raymond> the same method can be applied to extract a pixel from
an image
<BR>&lt;Raymond> void __forceinline ReadPixel(signed long x,signed long
y,FC_Image *lpImage,FS_Color *lpColor)
<BR>&lt;Raymond> {

<BR>&lt;Raymond> }
<BR>&lt;Raymond> note that out-of-bounds checking is done in thsi function
<BR>*** DeadKro1 (Fux4r@64.40.167.BOX-3589) Quit (Read error: 113 (No route
to host))
<BR>&lt;Raymond> makign higher level functions that use this one, not have
to haev such a check
<BR>&lt;Raymond> one thing that i always hear people saying
<BR>&lt;Raymond> is how they want to perform animation on a window
<BR>&lt;Raymond> short of using an avi file
<BR>&lt;Raymond> you can splice together all of your animation frames
<BR>&lt;Raymond> into one bitmap
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> :)
<BR>&lt;Raymond> load it into an HBITMAP using the LoadImageFunction
<BR>&lt;Raymond> and use BitBlt to actualy clip out
<BR>&lt;Raymond> and draw
<BR>&lt;Raymond> induvidual frames
<BR>&lt;Raymond> onto a window's device context
<BR>&lt;Raymond> another common question i hear is that they want to draw
images that have certain colors extracted
<BR>&lt;Raymond> i haev made a routine for this..pleae wait
<BR>*** hehe (hehe@BOX-24664.navipath.net) has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** hehe is now known as Raymond_2
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> ...
<BR>&lt;ElfQrin> The lecture's not bad but I need to sleep (3:21am here),
if someone would e-mail it to me, I'd appreciate it.
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> sorry about that io lost my connection
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> void ImageTint(FC_Image *lpImage,bool RedOFF,bool GreenOFF,bool
BlueOFF)

<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> }
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> this function allows you to turn off the color channels
or an image
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> *of
<BR>*** MOOCOWMOO has joined #BSRF
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> the function that i have that is similar to this
<BR>&lt;MOOCOWMOO> hrmm....
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> is for alphablending
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> nice ray
<BR>&lt;MOOCOWMOO> i think i cracked that wargame thing
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> void ImageFade(FC_Image *lpImage,FS_Color *lpColor,unsigned
char Alpha)
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> {
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2>&nbsp; unsigned long i=0;

<BR>&lt;Raymond_2>&nbsp; return;
<BR>&lt;MOOCOWMOO> or how to use it
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> }
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> this will put an overall color shade on an image
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> moocow we have a lecture
<BR>&lt;Mtcx> yeah, sh
<BR>&lt;MOOCOWMOO> ok i b quiet
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> hehe,
<BR>*** rek[away]&nbsp; Quit (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> so, getting back to the story
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> after about two years of research
<BR>&lt;ElfQrin> good nite, if someone could remember that please mail
this lecture to me when it'll be finished.
<BR>&lt;ElfQrin> cya
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> ive finaly come up with a very advanced multimedia and
game development engine
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> cya elf
<BR>&lt;snider> nitey nite
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> it sport's it's own image type called the GMB
<BR>*** ElfQrin&nbsp; has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and has the option of RLE compression
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> in some cases, for animation streams
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> compresion can be as high as 12 mb file to 2 mb file
<BR>*** Red_Death is now known as Smoking_Death
<BR>*** _sangoma-&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> the engine also supports an object framework
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> for creating buttons scrollbars
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> windows
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and the custom objects that are used in the engine
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> those being..
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> Actor2D
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> Actor3D
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> HotSpot
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> SpotLight
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and zBuffer object
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> the real power of this lecture is in that i am going
to distribute my engine to anyone who wants it
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> free of charge
<BR>*** essex Quit ()
<BR>&lt;blitz> i want it
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and to do with whatever you like
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> i have it
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> hehe
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> ;)
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> but, obviously
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> ther is no warently impiled
<BR>&lt;blitz> k
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and you face all conciquences of using it
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> yea pay respect to ray if you use it
<BR>&lt;blitz> k
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> he spent 2 years developing it
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> a comment about me would be nice
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> but not totaly neccisary
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> i simply want the people in the world to have the best
tools possible
<BR>&lt;NemoH> ray: what's the advantage of doing this vs using something
like directx or opengl?
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> the advantage of using my engine over DX or opengl
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> is that the software rendering that it does
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> is faster that the software rendering of directx
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> while it doesn nor support hardware modes
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> *not
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> it also requires no dependency
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> otehr than what win32 already has
<BR>*** sheepnus&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;blitz> so with those tools I ll have almost everything right?
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and the functionaly was built very moduarly
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> so you coudl adapt it to directX
<BR>&lt;NemoH> ray: well it's definitely tied to win32
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> with the file i am going to distribute
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> definetly
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> if you haev MSVC++ 6.0
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> you can use this engine
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> it may be possible to use it on other compilers
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> but i havent tested it on such
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> the engine has been tested on win95, 98, me and 2k
<BR>&lt;NemoH> and do you support all of the operation that directx does
or do they need to be implemented
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> i doont suport all of what directx does
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> for instance
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> i dont support a rotation blt
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> or an alphablt
<BR>*** Smoking_Death is now known as Red_Death
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> but ther implementation can be very easily worked into
the existing class structure
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> sicne bitmaped images are handled in the FC_Image Class
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and all other functions take a pointer to an FC Image
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> ther is lots of base functionalty
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and lots of room for expansion
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> the best part of the engine tho
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and actualy that part that i almost didnt wana give
away
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> is that it has a multichannel audio mixer
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> for async wave file play
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> :)
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> meaning that you could play up to 200 waves simultaniously
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> :)
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> yea that's alot
<BR>*** Raymond_2 (hehe@BOX-24664.navipath.net) Quit (Read error: 104 (Connection
reset by peer))
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> oh no
<BR>*** Raymond_2&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> Raaaaayyyyyy!!!!!!1
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> =)
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> lol peer took you away
<BR>&lt;snider> hehe
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> so, without futher or do
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> im going to give the source to snider
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and he will distribute it to those who want it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- Look near end of file
<BR>*** RealStony is now known as Stony
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> ray
<BR>&lt;blitz> k
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> can i put it up on my site?
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> people can go and grab it
<BR>&lt;Mtcx> pitpat - where's you site
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> you can, but obviously it would be nice if you gave
me a bit of credit on the site
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> yea
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> www.mmm69.com
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> nothing yet
<BR>&lt;blitz> ya
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> dont pass it off as your own, hve pride=)
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> lol
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> don't worry ray
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> i will now take any questions on the engine or the lecture
<BR>&lt;blitz> uhm...
<BR>&lt;blitz> so this program your talking about it will go faster right?
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> it provies the fastest possible output from the base
graphical system of windows
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> that is without using DirectX
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> or any other Library
<BR>&lt;blitz> cool
<BR>*** Trance has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** ArSeNiC&nbsp; Quit (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;Mtcx> so how do we get it?
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> it also supports the playing of avi movies and the like
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> im working with snider right now
<BR>&lt;blitz> ok
<BR>&lt;Mtcx> ok
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> k
<BR>*** Temp-nick is now known as AlienDaemon
<BR>&lt;snider> i'll send it, if you need it right away. or you can pick
it up from the lecture log (tomorrow)
<BR>*** XarZ&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Mtcx> where will the lecture log be?
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> im also including the documentation for the engine
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> not it is incomplete
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> *note
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> but it will shed alot of light on the objects
<BR>&lt;XarZ> damn....i missed a lecture
<BR>&lt;blitz> well I wanna wait for the documentation when can i get it
with everything?
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and also
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> if ther becomes the need
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and i get alot of intrest
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> let pitpat know about it
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and he will get back to me
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> :)
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and maybe we can post some code samples of the engiens
use on his page
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> :)
<BR>&lt;XarZ> what engine?
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> anything you want ray
<BR>&lt;XarZ> gfx?
<BR>&lt;XarZ> kewl
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> multimedia engine
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> specialy developed for games
<BR>&lt;XarZ> o
<BR>&lt;XarZ> kewl
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> but can be used for multimedia
<BR>&lt;XarZ> like a dX thing
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> and high quality sound and animations
<BR>*** AciBiBeR Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;Raymond_2> like dx, but it's standard win32
<BR>&lt;Mtcx> so where will the lecture log be tomorrow, where we can download
it?
<BR>*** MurDoch&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> Mtcx ask snider
<BR>*** Antid0t&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> snider?
<BR>&lt;blitz> I think he's busy
<BR>&lt;XarZ> well....the only thing i hate about dX is that u need the
whole SDK to use it correctly...and those are lots of filez...
<BR>&lt;snider> yeah i was gonna set up an auto-transfer script but what
the hell
<BR>&lt;pitpat-> snider are you gonna put it up on the site?
<BR>&lt;snider> yes, but i don
<BR>&lt;snider> err
<BR>&lt;snider> don't have access, so mikkkeee will have to get it first
<BR>*** _Dhamster-&nbsp; Quit (Quit: Leaving)
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> bsrf&acute;s site?
<BR>*** Antid0t&nbsp; Quit (Not enough time connected)
<BR>&lt;snider> blacksun.box.sk&nbsp; yes
<BR>*** MurDoch&nbsp; has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Pecca-ve> k
<BR>&lt;blitz> where's mikkkeee
<BR>*** Jesteruk&nbsp; has joined #bsrf
