<p>This is a tutorial explaining what a shell account is, how you can get one 
  and some basic commands. If you are thinking that you can find here shell scripting 
  or exploit hints, you are wrong. Wait for further tutorials. The first part 
  is just a bunch of questions with answers. After that I'll do a quick view about 
  shell flavours and where can you get shells for free.<br>
  So here we go.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">The Questions That Everybody Asks</font></b></p>
<p><b>Q:What is a shell account?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b>Ok...I think I won't be needing to explain what an account is, but 
  let's talk about the shell. You probably are using Windows, so your shell is 
  command.com and all that cute (crashing) Graphic environment. Being more precise 
  a shell is the program that translates and sends your commands to your system's 
  core. This happens because the core doesn't understand the commands you give. 
  For example, when you type &quot;cd ..&quot;, this command will be first translate 
  to a low language level by the shell and just after that, sent to the core (or 
  your CPU would drive mad). Do you imagine how painful would be using a computer 
  if you hadn't a shell? You needed to use a low language level, like assembler 
  or even worst (binary) to do something. If you wanted to do &quot;cd ..&quot; 
  you would have to write a bunch of push mem put mem blabla mem or a huge list 
  of 00101010. Do you really think that this would work with people? I don't think 
  so. Ok..Ok.. There are many persons that code in assembler, but I'm talking 
  about ordinary people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q:So you are saying that a shell is just a &quot;thing&quot; that translates 
  my inputs to the core, like command.com. But why do I want to connect to a remote 
  command.com, I've got my own in my box.</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> People like Shell Accounts because you don't connect to a Windows 
  box, but to a *nix box. If you can't have linux or any other *nix System at 
  home, you could get a Shell Account, and start playing with linux like if it 
  was in your own box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q:My friend is a *nix guru and he told me that some shells suck because 
  they are restricted what's that?</b></p>
<p>A:There are two kind of shells, the restricted shells and the non-restricted 
  shells. The difference between both is that usually restricted shells aren't 
  rented, they are free shells, but in those shells you can't execute every command 
  you want (for example, using a free shell they can keep you out of dig, nslookup 
  and telnet programs). On the therhand using non-restricted shells, you can run 
  any command you want but these kind of shells are paid (sometimes universities 
  give non-restricted shells to the students). Hey, but even if you have a restricted 
  shell don't be worried, some of them are really good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q: So you are saying that I can get a shell without paying for it?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes you can. For me the best place is at nether.net (other host that 
  is a free shell provider is freeshell.org), I'll guide you through the all process 
  later. Sometimes ISPs also give shell accounts to their users, so you may have 
  already a shell account and you don't know, phone to yours ISP's Support and 
  talk with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q: I phoned my ISP asking for a shell account, and they asked why did I 
  want one. What should I say?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Just tell that you really love to surf with Lynx, and that you want 
  to learn Unix. That should do. If they hang up, just go for the free shells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q: Hey I've got a shell, but how can I know if it's a good shell?</b></p>
<p>A: I think the answer is relative, it depends from the person who answer, for 
  me the things that make a good shell are listed below.</p>
<p>-&gt; Telnet (terminal emulator)<br>
  -&gt; Nslookup (Gives you information about the host)<br>
  -&gt; FTP (File Transfer Protocol, do I need to say anything else?)<br>
  -&gt; Finger (gets information about some user)<br>
  -&gt; Traceroute (The same as tracerT.exe in Windows, but much better)<br>
  -&gt; Dig (probably many of the restricted shells won't let you use, but don't 
  worry)<br>
  -&gt; Netstat (like in windows, lists all sockets and their status)<br>
  -&gt; GCC (c compiler, cool to do your own coding)<br>
  -&gt; Gzip (to [un]pack stuff)<br>
  -&gt; Lynx (Best Browser in the World)</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that a good shell for you needs to have this. For you a good 
  shell could be just a shell that allows you to telnet, like I said it's very 
  relative. But if your shell account doesn't let you use telnet, FTP and GCC, 
  you should get other shell account.</p>
<p>By now you should be getting bored of reading stupid questions, and even more 
  stupid answers, so let's get in another section. Let's talk a little about the 
  flavours of Shell Accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Quick View about flavours of Shell Accounts</font></b></p>
<p>There are may kinds of shell accounts, some of them are what we call home made 
  shells, other are the &quot;standard&quot; shell. Let's talk about the &quot;standard&quot; 
  shells.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Just for your information</b></p>
  <p>Home made shells are shells that are made by the sysop that owns the system, 
    <br>
    and it's just running in his system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I said there are plenty of shells.You've got:</p>
<p>-&gt; shell: Bourne Shell<br>
  -&gt; Bash : Bourne Again Shell<br>
  -&gt; Cshell: C Shell<br>
  -&gt; Tcsh: Technical C Shell<br>
  -&gt; Ksh: Kourne Shell<br>
  And many others. (I just listed those because it's the ones you can get at nether.net)</p>
<p>Each shell has their strong and weak points. For example the Cshell allows 
  you to type in C commands like if it were normal commands, that means that if 
  you type printf Hello it will be the same as echo in other shells(for the ones 
  who don't know C language, printf stands for printing in the screen the input 
  given). I won't explain the strong and weak points in each shell, you should 
  be the one doing that. Just get them at free shell providers at start exploring. 
  The only hint I'll give you is that Bash is the best shell for beginners, if 
  you want a more powerful shell just go to the C shell. Start with bash, explore 
  the system, learn some bash scripting, then start using other shells. Talk with 
  your friends that have others shells, ask what they think about it, you're getting 
  the idea, aren't you?;) If you already have one shell and doesn't know which 
  shell is it, just type in echo $shell and it will probably be shown your shell's 
  type. Since this is a quick view, I'll end here. Gonna help you getting a real 
  cool shell account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Getting a Shell Account At Nether.net</font></b></p>
<p>So are you ready to get your first shell account? Of course you are. The only 
  thing I don't like in nether.net is the offline time that the server sometimes 
  stays. So if you can connect to nether.net don't worry, since there are plenty 
  of people in that host sometimes he overflows and goes offline. Just wait some 
  hours and you probably can go online again.</p>
<p><b>------ Accessing nether.net ------</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1. (Getting your terminal emulator ready to roll)</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Open your telnet program, you can find it in windows directory under the 
    name telnet.exe</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  <b>Step 2. (Connecting)</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now that you are probably looking to the Telnet Window, select the Connect 
    menu, and in that menu select Remote System. It will be shown another box 
    asking you for the hostname, port and term type. Fill those fields with the 
    information below.</p>
  <p>Hostname: nether.net<br>
    Port: Telnet (or 23 it's the same)<br>
    Term Type: vt100 (it should be already in this value)</p>
  <p>You wait a little and...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>------ Getting the account ------</b></p>
<p><b>Step 3. (Logging in)</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now you should be looking at the nether.net banner. That says:</p>
  <p><br>
    Kernel SunOS 5.6 Generic_105181-17 on a sun4d<br>
    Welcome to nether.net</p>
  <p>New to the system? Login as newuser</p>
  <p>login:</p>
  <p>Now like they say use newuser as login. A program called newuser will start, 
    helping you creating an account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  <b>Step 4. (Customising Keys)</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>After a bunch of crap, the newuser program will ask you to Customise keys. 
    It will be asked the delete key (^H) and the break key (^C). What is in brackets 
    are the default if you want you can choose any other. The ^H stands for the 
    delete key (the one that has the &lt;- symbol on it), and the ^C stands for 
    ctrl+c. Attention don't write ^H or ^C just press the keys, and that will 
    be the output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  <b>Step 5. (Selecting Terminal Type)</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>After you customise the keys you'll be asked to enter your terminal type, 
    you can select ? and the program will print you all the terminals support 
    by it, but you should select vt100 or just press enter. Pressing enter the 
    program will assume that your terminal is a dumb terminal. There is no problem 
    to select the dumb terminal because you can change it later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  <b>Step 6. (Personal Data)</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It will be asked things like your full name, phone number, birth date, sex, 
    blablab, your getting the idea. If you want you can just put a . and press 
    enter. You can also give fake information, I think that 98% of the users at 
    nether.net did that. In the end of all the questions you'll be asked if you 
    want to hide the information from other users. Just say yes or no, I suggest 
    you to say yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  <b>Step 7. (Selecting Shell)</b></p>
<p>Now it will be shown a list with the legal shells, just select one, like I 
  said before if you are new to shell accounts choose bash shell.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Step 8. (Selecting Login)</b></p>
<p>Just select your login, like always 8 chars is the max length.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Step 9. (Selecting Password)</b></p>
<p>Select a password, it will be asked two times to see if the password is correct. 
  You can change the password later using the passwd command later.</p>
<p><b>Step 10. (Accepting Choices)</b></p>
<p>At this time you should be looking to something like:</p>
<table width="93%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr> 
    <td>full name:</td>
    <td>Full Name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>loginid: your username password:</td>
    <td> &lt;suppressed&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>address:</td>
    <td>your address if you gave any</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>telephone:</td>
    <td>your phone number if you gave any</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>other e-mail addresses:</td>
    <td>your e-mail address if you gave any</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>occupation:</td>
    <td>The same here</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>computers:</td>
    <td>Same</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>birthdate:</td>
    <td>Some date sex: Also something here</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>interests:</td>
    <td>Something how (did you find out about us): How do you find them</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Privacy switch</td>
    <td>on/off</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>shell:</td>
    <td>your shell account terminal: your terminal type erase '^H' kill '^U' interrupt 
      '^C'</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Type &quot;help&quot; for a list of things you can change.</p>
<p>Select thing to change or &quot;done&quot;?</p>
<p>Now if you agree with all the data just type done and press enter, or if you 
  want to change something just type the you want to change field.</p>
<p><b><br>
  Step 11. (After You type Done)</b></p>
<p>Now the program is checking if there is already your username, you should be 
  seeing a bunch of numbers scrolling, it's normal don't get scared... Now if 
  your Login name already exists will be asked another, if there isn't the system 
  will encrypt your password, and you'll stay for some time watching a bunch of 
  numbers scrolling. After that....</p>
<p><b><br>
  Step 12. (Congratulations You have a shell account)</b></p>
<p>Yep you've got a shell account, now you should be again in the login sequence 
  and your login name is already written just type in the password, press enter 
  and have fun.Remember that you can have many shells has you want. So if you 
  want you can login again with newuser but instead of choosing a bash shell choose 
  a Cshell and all the others or a shell bash again...</p>
<p><b><font size="4">The commands</font></b></p>
<p>Hi won't talk about of every command that exists in *nix systems, if I did 
  that the file would become huge. If you want to a big amount of information 
  about commands check the final notes section. The basic commands are listed 
  below with their function.</p>
<p>Syntax: command [switches] -&gt; description</p>
<p>man [command] -&gt; display the manual entry about the [command] you gave.</p>
<p>cd [directory] -&gt; like in DOS it changes your current directory, to go one 
  directory up you also use .., if you want to return to your home directory just 
  type cd without the [directory] parameter.</p>
<p>ls [-al] -&gt; ls makes the same as dir in DOS, it lists every file in the 
  directory, the -al is some of the switch you can use. Using this two switch 
  the listing will be displayed with hidden files, file permission, group and 
  owner. To know all the other switches man ls.</p>
<p>cat [file] -&gt; it's the same as the command type in DOS, it displays the 
  <br>
  content of the [file] given.</p>
<p>logout -&gt; Logs you out from your shell account.</p>
<p>who -&gt; Shows who's online, with information about those users. There are 
  programs that make you invisible to the who command, but that's another story, 
  probably in another tutorial.</p>
<p>ps [-aux] -&gt; ps shows every procedure that is running, something like ctrl+alt+del 
  in windows (not to reboot, but to show what's running) but much more powerful 
  since it isn't known how we can run a program without being display in ps. If 
  you run ps with no switches it will just show your own processes, if you use 
  the switch -aux it will list every process that is running in the machine.</p>
<p>joe [file] -&gt; joe is a text editor, it edits or creates the [file] given. 
</p>
<p>Sometimes the shell providers haven't joe but they should have vi (another 
  text editor).</p>
<p><br>
  This command should be enough for you to start. Also use man command in the 
  commands that we talk to get a bigger and more detailed description about it. 
  Good surfing!</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Final Notes</font></b></p>
<p>Now what you need is a little of practice, and good books to get in touch with 
  the commands. One of the best *nix books is UNIX IN A NUTSHELL. You can find 
  it in the books section at BSRF WWW page (<a href="http://blacksun.box.sk" target="_blank">http://blacksun.box.sk</a>). 
  For me, this is the best book about the subject, and since it's free I strongly 
  recommend you to get it. Another good thing is man. For example, if you want 
  to get some information about telnet, and how to use it, you just type in:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> man telnet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it will be prompt the manual page about telnet. If you are using a shell 
  in the freeshell server (<a href="http://freeshel.org" target="_blank">freeshell.org</a>) 
  you can also use the command help without any options. This will call you a 
  menu with the options you can call. And keep in mind that *nix is Case Sensitive 
  so Man, man and MaN or .profile and .Profile isn't the same thing.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Appendixes</b><br>
  ----------<br>
  A) Can I run IRC bots on free shell accounts? (by R a v e N) No!! Unless you 
  intend to be logged into your shell 24 hours a day. Free shell providers will 
  kill all of your running processes (running programs in the Windows world) once 
  you log off.</p>
<p>B) Are there are other places in which I can get a shell account? (by <a href="mailto:barakirs@netvision.net.il">R 
  a v e N</a>) Of course! Try <a href="http://www.cyberarmy.com/lists" target="_blank">http://www.cyberarmy.com/lists</a></p>
