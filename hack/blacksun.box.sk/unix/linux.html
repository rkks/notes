<p><b><font size="4">1.0 - Intro</font></b></p>
<p>Linux- sometimes referred to by the press as 'Windows NT's worst enemy'. Wired 
  Magazine once called it 'The greatest story never told'. This is a perfect definition 
  because the story behind Linux is indeed a great one, yet it is unknown to so 
  many people. Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Back when 'Stayin' Alive' was still topping the charts, and Microsoft was a 
  spec in the world of computers, AT&amp;T produced a multi-user operating system 
  and labeled it 'UNIX'. Throughout the years, UNIX caught on and many different 
  versions of it began to come out. A popular one, called 'Minix' (mini-UNIX) 
  was available for use at The University of Helsinki in Finland. A student at 
  the University named Linus Torvalds believed he could create an operating system 
  superior to Minix. In 1991 he started his new operating system as a side project, 
  but it soon developed into a full-time hobby until 1994 when the first official 
  version of the operating system was released.</p>
<p>You're probably now saying 'so what's the big deal about Linux? Isn't it just 
  another operating system?' Absolutely not! First of all, Linux is released under 
  something called 'open source license'. Open source is really more of an idea 
  than a thing. Linux is released with all the source code and files that it was 
  made with. This means a few things. Anyone who is good at programming can mess 
  with the Linux code and release his own version of it. This also means that 
  even though if you buy Linux in a store it will cost money, you're not paying 
  for the actual Linux itself. Your money goes to the price of packaging, the 
  extra software that comes with the operating system, and technical support. 
  The second, and most important reason that Linux is a big deal is because it's 
  a much more stable operating system than Windows. It runs on any system; even 
  bottom of the line 386's from before Linux even came out. Programs running under 
  Linux almost never crash, and in the off chance that one does because of bad 
  programming by the program author, it will not take the operating system down 
  with it. Another important reason Linux is good is that it is secure. It is 
  much harder to bring down by a hacker than Windows is (for further reading, 
  read the 'Basic Unix Security Guide' by R a v e N at blacksun.box.sk). This 
  is just an extremely short list of the reasons why Linux is so great. For further 
  reading check out<br>
  <a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_blank">www.linux.org</a></p>
<p>This tutorial is for Windows users who want to migrate to Linux. This is written 
  for Redhat or Mandrake Linux (the two most easy-to-install and user-friendly 
  Linux distributions), but the information here will most probably help you with 
  whatever distribution you are using. The only problem with this is that Mandrake 
  and RedHat are relativley simple to install, and some other distrobutions are 
  much more complex. I highly suggest you buy Linux-Mandrake rather than RedHat. 
  Mainly because it is cheaper and comes with more software, but as you read through 
  this tutorial, you'll see more reasons why I recommend Mandrake.</p>
<p>The first thing you're going to have to do with your new operating system is 
  install it- but you can't do that so quickly.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">2.0 - Preparation</font></b></p>
<p>If you already have Microsoft Windows on your system and you want it to co-exist 
  with Linux, you are going to have to create another hard drive partition. What 
  a hard drive partition is a totally separate part of a hard drive. If two hard 
  drive partitions weren't physically part of the same disc, they would be two 
  different hard drives. Anyway, the reason for this is that Windows and Linux 
  are totally different in the way they access hard drives and handle files. If 
  they are using each other's hard drive space the two operating systems can conflict 
  and cause major problems for your computer. Well, as I was saying, you need 
  to create a hard drive partition reserved for Linux. There are MS-DOS programs 
  that do this, but<br>
  they are &quot;lethal&quot; partition making programs. By this I mean that while 
  making a new partition, they can destroy or at least corrupt files on another 
  partition. If you want to make a partition for Linux, without killing your Windows 
  files you need a &quot;non-lethal&quot; partition program. If you get Linux-Mandrake, 
  a &quot;non-lethal&quot; partition program is included with it (this is just 
  one of the reasons why I recommend Mandrake over RedHat).</p>
<p>Well with all this talk of partitions and hard drives, you must be wondering 
  roughly how much hard drive space you'll need for Linux. If you want the complete 
  system with everything, you'll need about 1.5 gigabyte+ hard drive space. However 
  it is possible to productively run a full Linux distribution (there are &quot;miniature&quot; 
  Linux distributions that range from around 2 to 35 megabytes, and there's also 
  Trinux, which runs from two 1.44MB floppy disks! Get it from <a href="http://www.trinux.org" target="_blank">www.trinux.org</a>) 
  to with as little as 150 megabytes. Trust me, you don't want EVERYTHING. Linux 
  comes with tons of software you'll probably won't need. For example: Linux comes 
  with a variety of network servers - a web server, a Sendmail server, a telnet 
  server, an FTP server etc'. If you choose not to install something and then 
  regret, you can still get it later off the original installation CD.</p>
<p>So anyway, if you have sufficient hard drive space, and a &quot;non-lethal&quot; 
  partition program, you're ready to proceed to the next step: installation.</p>
<p>***Even if you're using a &quot;non-lethal&quot; partition program, I suggest 
  you backup your Windows files just in case something goes wrong.***</p>
<p><b><font size="4">3.0 - Installation</font></b></p>
<p>Now that your computer is ready for Linux, you're ready to install it. When 
  you bought the software, it probably came with a few CD's and a disk.</p>
<p>The disk is boot disk for the Linux installation program. You pop in the disk, 
  reset your computer, the installation program begins, and you're ready to install 
  Linux. The only thing is that the installation program will take a while to 
  load since it's from a disk.</p>
<p>**The stuff on the disk is probably just a duplicate of some of the stuff on 
  the first CD. If your computer is capable of booting from a CD (and most newer 
  ones are, otherwise, check your manual) then instead of putting the disk in 
  your computer then rebooting, put in the first CD as it will load much quicker. 
  Of course, you'll need to mess with your BIOS configurations first, but that's 
  no big deal. Hit del when your computer boots up (after it tells you how much 
  RAM you have) and mess around with it until you can find out how to make your 
  computer attempt to boot from your CD drive first. This differs from different 
  BIOS systems.**</p>
<p><b>3.1 - Ok..You're finally ready to install Linux.</b></p>
<p>The first few questions the install program asks you are self explanatory, 
  just things like your language and stuff. One thing you might get stumped on 
  is when you are prompted on whether you have any SCSI adapters or not. An SCSI 
  adapter can be anything such as a mouse, printer, scanner, etc. It all depends 
  if you have an SCSI controller. Chances are, you don't have any SCSIs, but check 
  your manual to be sure. Also, if you are completely sure that your copy of Microsoft 
  Windows is properly-configured, you can quit the installation program at any 
  time, return to Windows, run control panel, click on system and find out all 
  the information you'll need about your system's hardware.</p>
<p><b>3.2 - More Partition Stuff</b></p>
<p>The next thing you might have trouble with is a dialog box that appears asking 
  you some questions about your hard drive partitions. The name of the dialog 
  box should 'Disk Setup'. There should be three buttons on the bottom of the 
  box. One labeled 'Disk Druid', another labeled 'fdisk', and the last is the 
  back button. Since you already set up your partitions, select 'Disk Druid'. 
  If you originally only had one partition with windows, then the top of the screen 
  should look something like this:</p>
<table width="99%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Mount Point</b></td>
    <td><b> Device</b></td>
    <td><b>Requested </b></td>
    <td><b>Actual</b></td>
    <td><b>Type</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>hda1</td>
    <td>??MB</td>
    <td>??MB</td>
    <td>Win95</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>hda2</td>
    <td>??MB</td>
    <td>??MB</td>
    <td>Linux Swap</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>hda3</td>
    <td>??MB</td>
    <td>??MB</td>
    <td>Linux Native</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> Mount point should be blank.<br>
  'Device' is the name of the partition<br>
  'Requested' is the amount of hard drive space you wanted for the partition<br>
  'Actual' is the amount of hard drive space that is really in the partition<br>
  'Type' is what's in the partition</p>
<p><br>
  **The 'requested' and 'actual' sections for the 'Linux Swap&quot; type should 
  be the amount of RAM you have.**</p>
<p>**It looks confusing, but in reality if it is simple. Don't worry if your screen 
  doesn't look exactly like my diagram, it probably won't.**</p>
<p>What you should do now is select the 'Linux Native' section (by pressing tab 
  to get to that part of the screen, then using the arrow keys) and then press 
  tab again until the 'edit' button is highlighted. Pressing spacebar will bring 
  up another dialog box. In the space provided, put a slash (/) then press OK. 
  Now you're back at the main screen. Press tab to get to OK, and then press spacebar.</p>
<p>**what you're actually doing here is telling the computer to put the root directory, 
  signified by the slash, in the Linux Native partition. The root directory '/', 
  is similar to 'C:\' in DOS/Windows.**</p>
<p>Next you come to a screen asking which partitions to format. Select the one 
  that 'Linux Native' is in. You should select the '/dev/xxxx/' partition where 
  'xxxx' is the name of the device that the Linux Native partition is under. This 
  is where you put the '/' on the last screen. If the Linux Native partition device 
  was hda3 then choose '/dev/hda3', if it was hda6, then choose '/dev/hda6', you 
  get the point.</p>
<p>**IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO NOT SELECT THE WRONG PARTITION TO FORMART!**</p>
<p><b>3.3 - Selecting What to Install</b></p>
<p>Suppose you had three hard drives on Windows - c:\, d:\ and e:\, and you want 
  to install Linux on d:\. Windows assigns the letter c to the first hard drive 
  it finds that has a DOS/Windows file partition, d to the second DOS/Windows-compatible 
  hard drive etc', so this might help you out determining which device to choose. 
  Also, if you turn d:\ into the Linux hard drive, it will disappear from DOS/Windows, 
  and e:\ will turn into d:\.</p>
<p>You're not finished yet, but take a sigh of relief, the hardest part is over. 
  Next comes the screen asking which packages to install. Some of the most important 
  ones are selected already. If you have a lot of hard drive space, select all 
  the other packages. Otherwise, just select the others that you think are important. 
  Definitely select 'KDE' and 'GNOME'. Those are window manager programs for the 
  X-Windows system (a GUI - Graphical User Interface), and we'll deal with them 
  later. Anyway, newer versions always come with new software and/or updates for 
  old software.</p>
<p>Press OK and the Linux installation begins!</p>
<p><b>3.4 - Misc. Configurations</b></p>
<p>After everything has been installed, you are prompted for more things. The 
  first should be what resolution your monitor is. Most people would like to use 
  the same resolution they use on Windows, so if you don't know which resolution 
  you were using until now, switch back to Windows, right-click on your desktop 
  area, click properties and find the settings tab. You should see your current 
  resolution there. This would probably be the same resolution you would want 
  to use on Windows. If you want a higher resolution, consult your monitor's manual 
  to find out how high you can go.</p>
<p>Next is the mouse configuration. If your mouse is not on the list, select 'Generic 
  PS/2 Mouse'.</p>
<p>There are more such as clock set and time zone but those are self-explanatory. 
  After this, comes the services screen. These are the things that will startup 
  when you run Linux. Then it will prompt you for if you want the X-Windows interface 
  to run when you start Linux. If you are a Linux newbie (and you probably are, 
  unless you weren't reading this guide), I suggest you do this. X windows is 
  the GUI system, as explained before.</p>
<p>The last configuration is the printer. This is self-explanatory.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>3.5 - Configuring Users</b></p>
<p>Ok...you're almost done; the configurations are pretty much finished. Now you 
  will be prompted to create a password for the root operator. Even though it 
  is still very popular on single home users, Linux is a multi-user operating 
  system. Even if you'll be the only person using your computer, having a multi-user 
  system is quite benefical. For example: you can use a less-privileged user to 
  prevent yourself from doing stupid things and messing things up. You can run 
  sensitive software which can be broken to (say, some sort of a server. For example: 
  a Sendmail server for outgoing mail if you're planning to let people sent mail 
  from your machine, or a web server if you want to serve a website off your computer) 
  as a less-privileged user, so if someone will manage to exploit some hole in 
  this software, he will have very limited privileges (up to what the program 
  needs to run properly) and he won't be able to do much, or nothing at all in 
  most cases (he won't have read access to password files, he won't have write 
  access to the website's files so he won't be able to alter them etc'). On any 
  UNIX-based system (and there are many) the main user is called 'root'. The root 
  has supreme power over the system and supreme power over all the other users. 
  In fact, he has unlimited power (unless he or another root-privileged user chooses 
  to impose access limits, but root-privileged users can always restore their 
  rights to the fullest).</p>
<p>My root password is a particularly simple one. Mainly because I am the only 
  one who uses Linux on my computer (and besides that I trust my own family!) 
  and that my Linux system is not connected to the Internet (so hackers [or crackers 
  I should say] would have no way to get into my system). Make your password anything 
  not to complicated that you'll forget it, but something that is very hard to 
  guess.</p>
<p>After you're done making a password for the root user, you're prompted to create 
  an unprivileged, or ordinary user account. You make the user name, credentials, 
  and password. It may seem pointless at first to create another user- especially 
  an unprivileged one if you are the only one who is going to be using Linux. 
  However there is a big advantage to it. As a root user, you can do anything 
  to the system, including seriously messing it up. Nothing will stop you because 
  you are root. An ordinary user account is like security so if you mess up, the 
  system will stop you.</p>
<p><b>3.6 - Booting Configurations</b></p>
<p>Next you are asked if you want to create a boot disk. I strongly recommend 
  this because it will put the Linux boot stuff on the disk, not your computer. 
  If you put the Linux boot stuff on a computer with windows, it may conflict 
  with the windows boot stuff in case you ever reinstall Windows (go to blacksun.box.sk/byteme.html 
  and read #18 for a good example).</p>
<p>The Linux 'boot stuff' I'm talking about is a program called 'LILO'. That's 
  short for 'Linux Loader'. Anyway LILO installs itself to the boot sector of 
  the computer. The problem is that Windows also installs stuff to the boot sector. 
  LILO can install over Windows and let you choose to either boot up Linux or 
  Windows whenever you start up your computer. If you choose Windows, it'll use 
  Windows' &quot;boot stuff&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyway, in my opinion, when the install program asks you to create a boot disk, 
  click Ok, then follow the directions to create a boot disk. Oh yeah, by the 
  way, when you make a boot disk, it puts LILO on that disk. When it asks you 
  to install LILO, just press Skip (unless you want to install LILO, which most 
  users will).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You're done installing Linux! When the installation program 
  ends, take the installation boot disk out of the drive. If you booted the installation 
  from CD, don't forget to take that out too.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">4.0 - Running Linux</font></b></p>
<p>I bet you're glad to finish that installation! Now you're finally ready to 
  run the system. If you decided to create a boot disk, insert that into the disk 
  drive. If you decided to install LILO, just sit tight for now. Regardless of 
  what you did, reset your computer. If you used LILO, you will get a prompt to 
  load Linux or Windows. If you used a boot disk, the<br>
  system will startup automatically.</p>
<p>After the system starts up, the will get prompted for a user name and password. 
  This will look different depending on how you configured it in the installation. 
  If you chose to start the X Windows GUI automatically, the username and password 
  screen will look like it does in Windows (well, sort of. X-Windows is much cooler, 
  unless you're using some lame version of it or some lame window manager). If 
  you chose not to load the X Windows interface at startup (like most advanced 
  users will), you'll be presented with a text-based interface. The text-based 
  interface (the command console) is much faster than the graphical system, but 
  this also means you cannot view any graphics until you start X-Windows (this 
  is a good time to mention that most people just call it X). Anyway, you can 
  always run a command console from an X window (usually called an &quot;XTerm&quot;, 
  which stands for X Terminal). Anyway, the login screen will look pretty much 
  the same regardless of whether you are using RedHat or Mandrake.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what to type in the username box, that's easy. Your username 
  is 'root' (remember?). The password is the one that you selected at installation.</p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><b>5.0 - Using Linux</b></font></p>
<p><b>5.1 - Intro To The Console</b></p>
<p>Even though you'll probably be able to do everything with ease using the X 
  Windows GUI, there is still some stuff you should know. First off, don't rely 
  on a GUI for everything! That is very important because you will learn a lot 
  by using the console. The console is more powerful and can do a lot of things 
  you would REALLY like if you'll just grab a good basic Unix book and start learning. 
  After you do, you'll find yourself often opening an XTerm window to run some 
  console commands which you cannot run from X. If you selected to start the GUI 
  interface when Linux loads up, there are still lots of ways to get to the console.</p>
<p>The console prompt should look somewhat like this (if you're logged in as root):<br>
  [root@localhost.localdomian]#</p>
<p>The first part identifies who you are, and the '#' is the actual prompt. Any 
  almost and UNIX type system, the '#' means you are root. On non-root bash consoles 
  (BASH - Bourne Again Shell. BASH is the most popular text-based shell. Confused? 
  Don't worry, we'll get to that in a second) this will be replaced with a $. 
  Anyway, you can change the prompt, but we won't get into that now.</p>
<p><b>5.11 - Shells</b></p>
<p>You use a shell everytime you're in the Linux console. What a shell is, is 
  the program that communicates between you and the Kernel (the kernel is the 
  core of the system). Let's think of it as an interpreter for for two people 
  who are trying to have a meeting, except they don't speak the same language. 
  One speaks English and the speaks, oh let's say Hebrew (about half the members 
  of Black Sun Research Facility (blacksun.box.sk if you don't know the URL yet. 
  Also, if you havn't noticed, I'm a member of BSRF) are from Israel). To communicate 
  with each other they need a guy who speaks both English and Hebrew. If the English 
  guy wants to tell the Hebrew guy something, he tells it to the interpreter in 
  English, and then the interpreter tells it to the other guy in Hebrew, and vice 
  versa. Well anyway, getting back to the subject, this is the case with Linux. 
  Your language is the Linux commands, and the Kernel speaks it's own very complex 
  language. When you want to talk to the Kernel, you tell shell in your language, 
  and the shell tells it to the Kernel in it's language. On any Linux system, 
  there a few shells. Some of them are:</p>
<p>ash<br>
  bash<br>
  bsh<br>
  csh<br>
  tcsh<br>
  zsh</p>
<p>The most popular and powerful shell is 'bash' (borne again shell). We won't 
  go that much into shells, because you don't need to know that much about them 
  just yet.</p>
<p> <br>
  <b>5.2 - Navigating The File System</b></p>
<p>The most important thing to know when using the console is how to navigate 
  the file system without a graphical program.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand about this is that the bottom directory, the 
  directory that everything else is a subdirectory of is '/'. It's like 'C:\' 
  in Windows.</p>
<p>Ok, you start at the console and as a default you're either in your home directory 
  (every user has a home directory which contains his personal configurations 
  files). Now you want to navigate to another directory. But wait, you don't know 
  any other directories! You'll a directory listing for this, right? To do this 
  type 'ls' at the prompt. 'ls' is the equivlant to 'dir' in MS-DOS, and stands 
  for list. You'll get a list of files and folders. To make the list a bit more 
  readable, try ls -Fla. The -a shows files which start with a period (for example: 
  .Xclients-default). The -l displays file permissions and displays everything 
  in neat columns. The -F option adds a / after a directory and a * after an executable 
  file. I also<br>
  suggest using ls -Fla --color to let the system color-code different files (may 
  not be available on some systems).</p>
<p>Anyway, now that you what directories there are, you need to know how to get 
  into them. Luckily, you use the same command as you you use in MS-DOS, the 'cd' 
  (change directory) command. Let's say you're at the bottom directory, '/' and 
  you want to get to '/root'. You simply type 'cd root'. There is no need to type 
  'cd /root', because you're already in '/'. Now let's say you want to get to 
  '/root/bin'. This would be done by typing 'cd bin'. There is no need to type 
  'cd /root/bin' (the &quot;full path&quot; of the directory), since you're already 
  in '/root'. Instead, you can use a &quot;relative path&quot;, which is a path 
  that is relative to the current directory you're in. Type pwd to find out where 
  you are (pwd stands for print working directory).</p>
<p>Now let's say you're in '/root/bin' and you want to get to '/usr'. You would 
  type 'cd /usr'. This is to signify that the 'usr' directory is under '/', not 
  '/root/bin', or even '/root'. Got it? Ok, just one more thing. If you're in 
  a subdirectory, and you want to get to the top directory, just type 'cd ..'. 
  Let's say you're in '/root/bin', and you want to get to '/root'. You could<br>
  just type 'cd /root', but hey, '/root' is five characters! If you want to save 
  precious miliseconds, just type 'cd ..', since '/root' is the directory in which 
  '/root/bin' is a subdirectory of. So in other words, . is the current directory, 
  .. is one directory above, ... is two directories above etc'.</p>
<p><b>5.3 - Basic File and Directory Commands</b></p>
<p>There are lots of file and directory commands in Linux, but we'll start with 
  directory commands because they're easier. First off, you have 'mkdir'. 'mkdir' 
  stands for make directory and the context is:</p>
<p>mkdir the_directory_you_want_to_make</p>
<p>Some rulse apply. If you're '/', it will make the new directory under '/'. 
  If you're in '/usr', it will make the directory under '/usr'. Of course though, 
  if you're in '/' and you want to make a directory called 'stuff' under '/usr', 
  you would simply type '/usr/stuff'.</p>
<p>The next command is the 'rm' command. It works with files and direcotires and 
  is used to delete some, it stands for 'remove'. If you want to remove a file 
  called 'this.gif', you would go to the directory where that file is and type 
  'rm this.gif'. Or let's say again you're in '/' and 'this.gif' is in '/usr', 
  you would type 'rm /usr/this.gif'. It works the same way<br>
  with a directory.</p>
<p>Next are the 'cp' and 'mv' commands. They're both relativley simple, but we'll 
  start with 'cp'. 'cp' stands for copy, and is used to copy a file from directory 
  to another. The context is:</p>
<p>cp /directory_where_it_is/filename /directory_where_you_want_to_copy_it</p>
<p>Of course if you're already in the directory where the file is, all you need 
  to type is:</p>
<p>cp filename /directory_where_you_want_to_copy_it</p>
<p>'mv' works the exact same way, except it moves the file instead of copying 
  it. This means it deletes in from the original directory and puts it in the 
  new one.</p>

  5.4 - Finding and Viewing Commands</b></p>
<p>To find a file, oyu use the 'find' command. It then followed by the directory 
  where you want to start looking, then the '-name' arguement to say that you're 
  searching for a filename. Next you type the name of the file. Let's say you're 
  looking for the 'this.gif' in the '/usr' directory, the context would look like 
  this:</p>
<p>find /usr -name this.gif</p>
<p>The find command doesn't stop at filenames, it can also search a file for a 
  paticular string of text. It has the same context as the find file command except 
  you put quotes and asteriks around the string of text. So if you wanted to search 
  the '/usr' directory for a file containing the string 'hello', you would type</p>
<p>find /usr -name &quot;*hello*&quot;</p>
<p>Ok, once you find a file, you want to view it right? Well, you could open the 
  file with a text editor, but we haven't learned to use tetx editors yet, and 
  anyway if the file you want to view is important you might accidently change 
  it and save it using a text editor. That's what the 'cat' command is for. Let's 
  say you want to view a file called 'stuff.txt' in '/root'. You would navigate 
  to the '/root' directory and type 'cat stuff.txt'. Or from any directory, type 
  'cat /root/stuff.txt'</p>
<p>-= For more commands, buy a good basic Unix book =-</p>
<p><b>5.5 - linuxconf</b></p>
<p>There are lots of commands in Linux for configuring everything to user passwords, 
  networks, and the message that comes up when you start Linux. With so many things 
  to configure, luckily there is one program that does it all. <br>
  Just type 'linuxconf' at the command prompt, and you'll be brought to the Linux 
  Configuration program.</p>

  5.6 - Mounting</b></p>
<p><b>5.61 - Mounting Drives</b></p>
<p>In Linux, drives not only have to be physically mounted to the computer, but 
  mounted in software too. In the KDE and GNOME GUIs, you can easily mount a CD-ROM 
  or disk drive by clicking on the 'CD-ROM' or 'Disk Drive' icons on the desktop.</p>
<p><b>5.62 - How to mount</b></p>
<p>Remember earlier in this tutorial when we went over how a hard drive partition 
  is almost like a separate hard drive? Well, just like a separate drive, partitions 
  also have to be mounted. The main use in this is being able to<br>
  mount Windows partition and access Windows files in Linux. Obviously, Windows 
  software will not run under Linux but there is still a use for accessing Windows 
  files in Linux.</p>
<p>Let's say you can't use the internet in Linux. You ISP only allows to dialup 
  with software and they don't make it for Linux, you're not used to Linux yet 
  so you don't want to use the net in it yet. This is a down point, but it doesn't 
  mean you can't download Linux files to use. All you have to do is download the 
  files in Windows and access them in Linux.</p>
<p>To mount a windows partition in Linux, yhe first thing you must do is create 
  a directory in Linux where you will mount the windows partition to reside. Go 
  into file manager (it should be under utilities no matter what distribution 
  you're using) and create a new directory under '/'. Call anything, I suggest 
  calling it 'windows'. Now exit file manager and go<br>
  into 'terminal' (should also be under utilities). Terminal will give you a command 
  prompt just like MS-DOS. This is what you would have to do everything from if 
  there were no X Windows GUI. The command to use is simply enough- 'mount'. But 
  don't type it just yet, you need to give the system more info. The full command 
  is</p>
<p>mount -t vfat /dev/xxxx /yyyyyyy (yes there is a space between 'xxxx' and '/')</p>
<p>Or mount -t vfat32 /dev/xxxx /yyyyyyy in case this is a FAT32 partition.</p>
<p>Where 'yyyyyyy' is the directory you just created, and 'xxxx' is the device 
  name of the partition where Windows resides. It is usually hda1 or something.</p>
<p>There, now just go into file manager and click on the directory you created 
  and you will have all the files that are on your windows partition.</p>
<p>When you're done, don't forget to unmount the drive by typing:</p>
<p>umount /dev/xxxx /yyyyyyy </p>
<p>Each time you want to access your windows files, just mount the partition (unless 
  they're set for automount. Edit /etc/fstab, find the line that represents your 
  Windows partition and look for a place with says noauto. If you find the word 
  noauto, change it into defaults. If you don't, your Windows partition will probably 
  get automounted whenever you boot-up Linux). When you're done with them, just 
  unmount the partition.</p>
<p><b><br>
  5.7 - Runlevels</b></p>
<p>While Windows is booting, have you ever pressed the F8 key? Well, if you have, 
  you're probably familiar with a screen that pops up giving you a list of ways 
  you can load Windows. There's safe mode, command prompt, step-by-step confirmation, 
  etc. Linux has something just like that, and they're called 'runlevels'. There 
  are six runlevels in all, and some are pretty much the same. A runlevel is a 
  list of commands to load-up as soon as you start up Linux (there's a mini-tutorial 
  about runlevels at blacksun.box.sk/byteme.html). Your default runlevel is probably 
  5. If you configured the GUI to start up when you boot the system, and if your 
  default runlevel is 5, then that is the runlevel configured to boot the GUI 
  when it starts up...simple, right?</p>
<p>Well anyway, if you use linuxconf to change your default runlevel to 2 or 3 
  or something, then you change it so that the GUI won't start as soon as the 
  system boots....all without touching the actual runlevel. When you want to change 
  it back, just use linuxconf to set the default runlevel back to 5.</p>
<p>Now let's say you only want to load it without the GUI coming up once. Instead 
  of having to change the configuration in linuxconf, and then changing it back, 
  you can load Linux into another runlevel. Suppose You want to load runlevel 
  2...not for any paticular reason, just because it's not configured to load the 
  GUI when it boots up, and well, you like the<br>
  number 2. To do this, as soon LILO comes up (whether it's on your computer, 
  or your boot disk), you have the option to type something next to 'boot:'. Just 
  type 'linux x'. 'x' refers to the number of the runlevel, in this case the number 
  2, so you type 'linux 2', and press enter. This will load Linux without loading 
  the GUI. When you restart Linux, it will load the default runlevel again.</p>
<p>For an interesting runlevels-related local hack, read the Byte-Me mini-tutorial 
  about runlevels at blacksun.box.sk/byteme.html.</p>
