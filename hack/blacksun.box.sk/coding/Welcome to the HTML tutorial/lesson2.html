I'll bet you're thinking "Structure and Method? What is 
this... some kinda textbook???"  Well, no, in this 
lesson you'll be learning about the <b>Structure</b> 
of HTML and the <b>Method</b> that is used to make them.<p>

HTML is not coded with some special "HTML tool", and you 
do'nt even need some special program to make HTML pages, 
like Microsoft FrontPage (In fact, I discourage their use 
until you know the ins and outs of HTML code).  All that 
you DO need is a simple text editing program like Notepad.<p>

You're probably thinking "Wait just one second, you're

of the beauty of HTML!  How do we do this?  Keep reading!<p>
