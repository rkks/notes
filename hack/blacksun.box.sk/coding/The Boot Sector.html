<a name="1"><h3><u>1. Introduction</u></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Well usually I give you a specific purpose at this point, but in this case I can't.
I was just in the mood to write something on boot sectors so I did it.  And maybe
(hopefully) someone out there can make use of this info.  This thing will most likely
became part of a larger tutorial, maybe something on assembly or on OS design.
After having consumed this text file you should know enough to design and create your
own boot sector, maybe for a virus, or an OS, or...?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="1a"><h3><u>What you need</u></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Before reading this you should have a basic knowledge of assembly.  If you don't, read
my other tutorial, it's called Sk00l m3 ASM!!#@$!@# and is available from awc.rejects.net
We will be using 2 different programs to code this shit: NASM and TASM.  NASM is freely
available from <a href="http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/" target="_blank">http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/</a>, but TASM you have to buy.  I don't like
piracy, but if you're just gonna use TASM this once, don't bother spending $150 on it.
There are plenty of sites that have a copy.</p>
<p>Why am I using 2 different programs?  Well I have always used NASM to make simple
programs as it's good at creating efficient memory copies.  I always use TASM to make
programs a bit more complex.  In the end however it comes down to the answer "why not??".
However, it shouldn't be hard at all to make the TASM program in NASM (or the other way
around), just change a few things here and there.  If enough people come bitch to me, I'll
rewrite all the code for NASM/TASM.</p></blockquote>
<a name="2"><h3><u>2. Basic hard drive/BIOS shit</u></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As soon as you flip that switch, your CPU starts executing shit located at F000:FFF0.
This area contains the BIOS, Basic Input/Output System.  This code is written in assembly
and is stored in chips called EPROMs in your computer.  This code will perform something
known as POST, Power On Self Test.  This checks for installed devices and checks if they
all work.  In particular it checks for the video card and runs the video BIOS usually
located at C000h.  Next it checks for other ROMs to see if they have installed BIOSes.
Usually it then finds and executes the hard drive BIOS located at C8000h.  Then it starts
something like a "system inventory" where it checks for other installed devices and
tests them.  It does some more stuff that's all basicly useless for us right now,
until it finally transfers control over to the operating system.  That's the part that
we're interested in.  Back in the old days, only one OS was installed on a computer.
If you bought a certain computer, you could only run the OS that was made for it.
Nothing else.  Obviosly that wasn't such a good thing as you would have to buy a new
computer if you wanted a different OS, so BIOS makers came up with the Boot Sector.
In case you didn't know yet, a Sector is the smallest area your hard drive can access.
According to the ATA standards each sector is exactly 512 bytes.  However ATA standards
only apply to hard drives, things like floopies can use whatever they want.
Knowing this we can move on to the boot sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><u>3. Making a Boot Sector</u></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After the BIOS has successfully completed the POST it calls interrupt 19h.  You can
actually see this by dumping the memory located at F000:FFF0.  For example, on my box
I used debug with the following result:<br>
<i>-d f000:fff0</i><br>
F000:FFF0  CD 19 E0 00 F0 31 31 2F-32 36 2F 39 39 00 FC 81   .....11/26/99...</p>
<p>As you should know, CD = INT.  INT 19h attempts to read in the Boot Sector of the 1st
floppy disk.  If it fails it does the same thing on the 1st hard drive.  If that fails
it returns an error message.  A valid boot sector must have its last two bytes set to
AA55h.  Assuming a valid boot sector is found, the code is loaded into memory at location
0000:7C00 and interrupt 19h jumps there to start executing the code.  Since a boot sector
has to fit into one sector (512 bytes) it can't really do much, usually it does a search
for another file on another sector, then executes it.  Our boot sector won't do that.
For now it is enough that it displays a message and reboots when you press a key.  Since
DOS is not loaded yet, we have to use BIOS interupts to do all this.  First we display a
messages using interupt 10h.  Next we wait for the user to press a key using interrupt
16h, and finally we make a FAR jump to FFFF:0000 which we restart the computer.  So lets
code this bitch:</p>
<p>First we use the code</p>

  <td>ES:BP must point to the string, since a boot sector starts at 07C00, we add that
     to BP after we loaded it.  You could also set the entry point of the program to
     07C00, or change the data segment register to point to 07C00, but since it's just
     one instruction, this is fine for now.</td>

</table>
<p><b>Registers:</b><br>
AH - 00, Read keyboard buffer, wait till full if not already.<br>
The buffer will be empty since the computer didn't get time to put anything into it yet.
Finally we reboot the computer by simply jumping to 0000:FFFF:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DB 0xEA<br>
     DW 0x0000<br>
     DW 0xFFFF</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks a bit wierd but it's actualy quite simple.  When declaring "variables" in
assembly, the assembler simply puts the value into a memory location.  Usually you
use interrupts or something to point to them in order to use and manipulate them, but we
could also put code there.  This is what we're doing here.  If you get a Hex to Mnemonix
chart you will notice that EA is a Far Jump.  So we put that into memory, followed by
the location to jump to.</p>
<p>Next we fill the the remaining memory with NULL:<br>
<blockquote>
     TIMES 510-($-$$) DB 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could also be done in TASM with something like TIMES 510 DUP (0).
Finally we have to add those two bytes to the end so that the BIOS will know that this is
a valid boot sector. This is done with the simple statement:<br>
<blockquote>
SIGNATURE DW 0xAA55</p>

</table>
<p>Assemble with "nasm filename.asm".  This will get you a file called "filename", no
extension.  It is a raw binary image of the code.  Get out a floppy and type
"debug filename".  Enter this at the prompt: w 100 0 0 1.   You should know what this
does from my assembly tutorial, if not it simply means write whatever is in memory to
location 100 on disk 0 (A:), starting from sector 0 to sector 1.  Now try booting from
this disk.  You should get the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pR3sS 4nY k3y 2 k0n71nu3<br>
btw, ph33r</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when you press a key, the keyboard buffer gets filled so interupt 16h is finished and
we move on to the restart procedure.  Obviously this was just a simply example, instead
of printing a string, waiting for a key press and restarting, you could've put anything
in there, just as long as you don't use DOS interupts.  One nice thing might be to get
into Protected Mode, or you could even do some graphics shit which might run faster than
in DOS or Windows since nothing is in memory except what you want to be there.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><u>4. Making a program to write a boot sector</u></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you tryed to access the disk with your boot sector on it, you'll notice that you
can't.  At least not using DOS.  That's because DOS uses a few bytes of memory for data
that it needs to know in order to determine what kind of disk it is, our program however
uses those bytes for the code.  Now, you could look up those memory areas and declare
them at the start of your program, but instead we will just create a program that will
write any kind of file directly to the boot sector of a disk, regardless of what's on
that disk.  This sounds harder than it really is.  In fact, the resulting program is
a mere 73 bytes.  First of all we have to open the file we want to write to the boot
sector using the code:</p>
<p>READFILE:<br>
<blockquote>
    MOV AX,3D00h<br>
    MOV DX,OFFSET FILENAME<br>
    INT 21h</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AH = 3Dh, Open file<br>
AL = 00, open file as read only<br>
DX = Points to file name.  This has to be a ASCIIZ string, meaning it's terminated with
     a NULL character (0).</p>
<p>This will return the file handle in AX.  If an error has occured, the carry flag will be
set and the error code stored in AH.  In that case, branch:<br>
<blockquote>
    JC ERROR<br>
</blockquote>
Otherwise proceed to reading in the file:<br>
<blockquote>
    MOV BX,AX<br>
    MOV AH,3Fh<br>
    MOV CX,0200h<br>
    MOV DX,OFFSET SHIT<br>
    INT 21h</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First we move the file handle from AX into BX, then set up the other registers as
follows:<br>
AH = 3Fh, Read file<br>
CX = 200h, Amount of data to read.  Since a boot sector will always be 512 bytes long
     we read in 200h bytes (512d).<br>
DX = Points to memory area to hold contents of file<br>
Again, the carry flag will be set if an error occured, so branch:<br>
<blockquote>
    JC ERROR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we're getting to the actual writing part.  First we reset the floppy disk controller
with the code:<br>
WRITE_SECTOR:<br>
<blockquote>
    MOV AH,0h<br>
    MOV DL,0<br>
    INT 13h<br>
</blockquote>
Next we write the data:<br>
<blockquote>
    MOV AX,0301h<br>
    MOV CX,1<br>
    MOV DX,0<br>
    MOV BX,OFFSET SHIT<br>
    INT 13h</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the more complicated interupts, and you have to know some shit about how
hard drives are made up.<br>
AH = 03h, Write Sector<br>
AL = 1, Number of sectors to write on same track and head<br>
CH = 0, Track number to write<br>
CL = 1, Sector number to start writing from<br>
DH = 0, Head number to write<br>
DL = 0, Drive number to write (0 = A, 1 = B, etc)<br>
BX = Buffer to write sector(s) from</p>
<p>Again the carry flag is set if an error occurs, but I like to keep things interesting and
used a different method to check for an error.  The error code is stored in AH, if AH
is 0 there was no error.  So to check for an error I can simply XOR AH, AH and Jump if
Not Zero.<br>
<blockquote>
    XOR AH,AH<br>
    JNZ ERROR<br>
</blockquote>
Otherwise, we're done and can terminate the program:<br>
<blockquote>
    INT 20h</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the finished program looks like this:<br>
<table>
<tr>
  <td width="250">MAIN SEGMENT</td>
  <td width="300">;the usual setup I use for .com files</td>
</tr>
</table>

    JC ERROR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

    INT 13h<br><br>

    MOV AH,03h<br>
    MOV AL,1<br>
    MOV CX,1<br>
    MOV DX,0<br>
    MOV BX,OFFSET SHIT<br>
    INT 13h<br><br>

    XOR AH,AH<br>
    JNZ ERROR<br><br>

    INT 20h</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ERROR:<br>
<table>
<tr>
  <td width="250">MOV AH,09h</td>
  <td width="300">;displays error message</td>
</tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
    MOV DX, OFFSET SHIT1<br>
    INT 21h<br>
    INT 20h</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
  <td>SHIT</td>
  <td>DB ?</td>
  <td>;uninitialized array to hold contents of file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>SHIT1</td>
  <td>DB 'Error$'</td>
  <td>;Bad ass error message</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>FILENAME</td>
  <td>DB 'ph33r',0</td>
  <td>;filename to write</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="2">MAIN ENDS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="2">END START</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now this thing is very very basic.  There are many areas you could improve on.  For
example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the filename a user inputed value.  To do so, make FILENAME an array of 12
    unitialized bytes (DOS filenames can't be longer than that).  Than load that array
    into SI and call interupt 16h, function 0h.  Loop it until enter is pressed, store
    the value in SI, incrementing SI each time.</li>
    <li>Add more error messages, maybe even something that checks the error code and response
    with an appropriate message</li>
    <li>This program wont wait for the motor to start up, so make a loop that loops about 3
    times, checking if the disk drive is ready.  If all tries fail, return an error
    saying that the disk is not in the drive or something.  The error code is returned in
    AH, so you can make a simple check and respond with the corrosponding error message.</li>
    <li>Display a (C) Microsoft message</li>
</ol>
