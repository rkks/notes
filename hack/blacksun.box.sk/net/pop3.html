<h3><u>What is POP3?</u></h3>
<p>POP stands for Post Office Protocol. It is the protocol (a common language
that is used by computers to exchange information between different hardware
components, different computers over a network etc'. A computer protocol is
pretty much the same as a regular human language) used to check any
non-web-based Email account.</p>
<p>A web-based Email account is an Email box that can only be used through a
certain website. During your stay in this website, you are exposed to ads
which the company who provides you with this mailbox profits from. Web-based
Email services are always free because instead of paying, you pay the company
who handles your mailbox by watching these ads (unless this mailbox features
some extremely special services or features that cost more money).</p>
<p>Hence, a non-web-based Email account is an account that is accessed using an
Email client or a regular telnet client, if you know the necessary protocols
(after you finish reading this tutorial and the Sendmail tutorial, you would
know how Email works and how to compose and receive Email without the need of
any program besides a telnet client).</p>
<p>Non-web-based Email accounts use two protocols - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol) to send Email and POP (Post Office Protocol) to receive Email. You
can study the SMTP protocol in the Sendmail tutorial, and as for POP - you'll
get to learn it right now. In case you're wondering, POP3 is just a newer
version of POP.</p>
<h3><u>Why would I want to learn the POP protocol?</u></h3>
<p>Oh, there are a lot of reasons why you would want to do that. I'll give you a
couple of examples out of my head:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Have you ever been mail-bombed? If not, can you imagine how it is to have
to receive and then delete hundreds or even thousands of messages? Well, no
more! After you'll read this tutorial you would be able to delete Email right
off the mail server without having to receive it and then delete it from your
Email client (some Email clients won't let you group several mails and delete
all of them in one shot so you have to delete them one by one, which would
make your job even more difficult).</li>
<li>You would have the ability to read your Email from anywhere in the world.
Sure, many people would say "but we can always go to www.readmail.com, enter
our Email address and our password and we'll be presented with a nice
interface which will let us read our Email and delete messages from anywhere
around the world. Why would we want to learn the POP3 protocol instead?" Well,
there's a serious security problem with using websites such as
www.readmail.com. For example: some browsers support an option called "form
completion". The browser records the data you type into forms and then, when
you return to a form and start filling it out, it will fill all the rest for
you.<br>
Now, what happens if you use www.readmail.com on some computer, and then
someone else comes over and fills in your Email address? That's right! The
browser will complete the rest of the form, thus reveal your password! This
was just an example of what insecurities readmail.com might pose.</li>
<li>The POP3 protocol isn't so complicated. In fact, it's quite easy, so hell,
why not learn it just for fun, huh?   :-)</li>
</ol>
<h3><u>Alright, let's go!</u></h3>
<p>The first thing you will need is a regular telnet application. No need for
anything fancy. Unix has a native telnet client (simply type telnet
hostname/IP to telnet to that hostname or IP into port 23 or telnet
hostname/IP port to choose a port other than 23). Windows 95 and above also
come with a telnet application (it's in c:\windows\telnet.exe, but you can
also press start, run and type telnet to run it, telnet hostname/IP to telnet
to that hostname or IP and into port 23 or specify a port other than 23 with
telnet hostname/IP port).</p>
<p>Next, you need to find your POP3 mail server. Usually it would be something
like mail.your-isp.net. For example: my ISP is netvision.net.il, so my POP3
server is located at mail.netvision.net.il. If you already have an Email
client that is configured correctly for your POP3 box, go to your preferences
dialog boxes and you should be able to find your incoming mail server address
there.</p>
<p>Okay, looks like we're pretty much ready for this. Next thing, we telnet to
our POP3 server and into port 110 (the default port for POP3). This is what I
get when I telnet into my POP3 page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+OK POP3 [194.90.1.6] v7.60 server ready</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, looks good so far. Now we need to identify ourselves. We need to supply
our username and password. Your username would usually be in your Email
address. For example: my Email address is barakirs@netvision.net.il, therefore
my username is barakirs. So we type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>user barakirs (or whatever username you have)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the server replies with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+OK User name accepted, password please</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next thing, we need a password, right? So we do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pass your-password</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the server replies with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+OK Mailbox open, x messages (when x is the number of messages you have in
your inbox)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-ERR Bad login</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we supply the wrong password. Now, we want to see what we have, so we first
type list to see the list of Emails we currently have (unless, of course, we
have 0 new messages). For each Email, we would get a separate line which will
contain a message number (a number that identifies each message) and a number
that would indicate the size of each message.</p>
<p>Next thing, we want to read our messages. To do this, we type retr #. Retr
stands for retrieve. # should be replaces by the message's number. We
would then get a full message header (see Sendmail tutorial) and the body of
the message.</p>
<p>After we read the message, we would probably want to delete it. In order to do
that, we type dele #. Dele stands for delete. # should be replaced by the
message's number.</p>
<p>Once you're finished, type quit to close your session.</p>
<h3><u>Final notes</u></h3>
<p>Yup, that's all! Oh, just one more thing - when you log into your POP3
mailbox, it gets locked up so noone can access it while you're inside. A "lock
file" is created when you log in and is deleted when you log out, and whenever
someone tries to log in the server allows him access only if the lock file
does not exist (which means that there's nobody currently logged in).</p>
<p>See? It's easy. I hate to tell you "I told you so" but... &nbsp; &nbsp; :-)</p>
