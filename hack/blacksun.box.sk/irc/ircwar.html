<A NAME="irc"></A><B><U>[What is IRC?]</U></B>
<BR>IRC stands for "Internet Relay Chat". Jarkko Oikarinen originally wrote
it in 1988. Since starting in Finland, it has been used in over 60 countries
around the world. It was designed as a replacement for the "talk" program
but has become much, much more than that. IRC is a multi-user chat system,
where people meet on "channels" (rooms, virtual places, usually with a
certain topic of conversation) to talk in-groups, or privately. There is
no restriction to the number of people that can participate in a given
discussion or the number of channels that can be formed on IRC.

<P><A NAME="intro"></A><B><U>[An introduction to the way IRC works]</U></B>
<BR>All the communications in the world of IRC are done through the server.
(This does not includes the DCC (Direct Client Communication) protocol)
<BR>When you connect to a server, you send it 2 commands: NICK &amp; USER.
These commands are used to identify you on the IRC. Here is the format
of the commands:
<BR>NICK nickname - Sets your nickname
<BR>USER username host server :real name - Set your userid and real name.
Host is your host and server is the server you are connecting to.
<BR>For example to open a raw IRC session you can telnet to an IRC server
on port 6667 or 7000 (the standard ports). Here is an example for telneting
my localhost (note: the lines beginning with * have been written by me.
The rest are the output I got from the server):
<BR>* nick ^TCG^
<BR>NOTICE ^TCG^ :*** If you are having problems connecting due to ping
timeouts, please type /notice E3AA3478 nospoof now.
<BR>PING :E3AA3478
<BR>* user ^TCG^ 127.0.0.1 localhost :The Cyber God
<BR>:localhost 001 ^TCG^ :Welcome to the DALnet IRC Network ^TCG^!~tcg@thegod.actcom.co.il
<BR>:localhost 002 ^TCG^ :Your host is localhost[thegod.actcom.co.il],
running version dal4.6.7.DreamForge.win32
<BR>:localhost 003 ^TCG^ :This server was created Fri Jul 24 07:48:52 1998
<BR>:localhost 004 ^TCG^ localhost dal4.6.7.DreamForge.win32 oiwsghOkcfrRaAb
biklmnopstvR
<BR>:localhost 005 ^TCG^ NOQUIT TOKEN WATCH=128 SAFELIST :are available
on this server
<BR>:localhost 251 ^TCG^ :There are 0 users and 0 invisible on 1 servers
<BR>:localhost 253 ^TCG^ 4 :unknown connection(s)
<BR>:localhost 255 ^TCG^ :I have 0 clients and 0 servers
<BR>:localhost 265 ^TCG^ :Current local users: 0 Max: 0
<BR>:localhost 266 ^TCG^ :Current global users: 0 Max: 0
<BR>:localhost 422 ^TCG^ :MOTD File is missing
<BR>:^TCG^ MODE ^TCG^ :+iw
<BR>...

<P>ok

<P>As you can see, the second parameter of the USER commands includes my
IP. You might be thinking right now that you could enter any IP you want
and fake your IP. Well you are wrong. On really older versions of the IRC
daemon (Those that were used in Efnet), you WAS able to spoof your IP.
But today there are 2 types of antispoof-patches: The one that doesn't
care about the IP you entered and connects you using your real IP (which
it gets from the socket) and the other one just doesn't allow you to connect
to the server until you give your real IP address.
<BR>The first method of Anti-Spoofing is most used most in the server version
of DALnet and the second is used most by EliteIRCD (which is based on DALnet)
and the servers that are based on it.
<BR>Now, if it all goes ok then you just opened a raw session to IRC!
<BR>All the data transferred to the user (Private Messages/Notices and
Channel Events) is transferred from the server. If the user that sent you
a message is on a DIFFERENT server than you (but NOT a different network)
the message "moves" from the servers until it reaches your server and you.
To send someone a message in our raw IRC session type: 'PRIVMSG nick :message'
(without the quotes) where nick is the target nickname and message is the
message (You must include a : before the message).
<BR>When a message moves from server to server it looks like this:
<BR>:SenderNick PRIVMSG nick :message
<BR>All the IRC commands move from server to server like this. For example
when someone uses the NICK command ALL the servers get a notice about it.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="irc networks"></A><B><U>[Some notes on different IRC networks
and their daemon software]</U></B>
<BR>Different IRC networks have different IRC daemons. It is important
to know the futures / limits of the server your network uses. For example,
OLD Efnet servers don't know the +b channel mode (ban someone). When trying
to start IRC wars you need to know what are the limitations of the server.
If it got services, if so does they have a bug that can crash them? Can
you obtain Channel Operator in a net-split (we'll get to that)? And so
on... During the rest of this tutorial we will discuss different daemon
software and bugs, as well as different ways to "get in".

<P><A NAME="irc war"></A><B><U>[Why IRC wars started?]</U></B>
<BR>Generally, IRC wars started on the IRC network Efnet. In this IRC network
you can't register your nickname so ANYONE can use it. If for example someone
logged to this IRC network (By the way, did you know that it is the first
IRC network ever (!)) and he saw that his nick is taken. He probably said
something like "How Rude?!" or "Mother-F*cker" or anything else. Then he
started thinking about ways to get this user off the server. Users started
to try many different things on each other and that's pretty much how IRC
wars started. Today, users might start IRC wars "just for fun", or for
taking over channels they don't like or kicking off users they don't like.

<P><A NAME="know me"></A><B><U>[What do the others know about me?]</U></B>
<BR>OK people! This is actually the first important thing about the IRC
wars. Before starting out you need to know what others can find out about
you and what can you find out about them.

<P>If you are not connected through a BNC, firewall or a shell (we'll get
to this neat stuff later), what I mean, that if you are connected directly
to the IRC, using a dial-up for example users can first of all knows your
IP. Newbies might say right now, ok... well.... So he knows my IP... who
gives a shit anyway?
<BR>Well if you said this you are wrong. Let's take a look on my host (resolved
IP) for example:
<PRE>P34.haifa2.actcom.co.il
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ You can see that my ISP is in Israel, and so am I (unless
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm dialing to foreign ISPs just to cover my identity, which&nbsp;
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a thing people don't do because of... financial issues).
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ You can see that my ISP (Internet Service Provider) is Actcom
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ You can see that I am from Haifa ).
|_My modem number at the ISP's office.</PRE>
See how many things the host gave you?
<BR>1) My ISP
<BR>2) My city
<BR>3) My country
<BR>Now You can also know that if my ISP address is actcom.co.il you can
send complains about me to abuse@actcom.co.il for example, give them my
IP and tell them what I did to you and they will do the rest.

<P>That is what users know about you. Some times you will only see numbers
like 19.114.47.1 and not the host. That is because the server failed to
resolve your hostname. To resolve it you can download a program called
'nslookup' from somewhere (note: nslookup comes with all Unix systems),
give it the IP and it will try to resolve it. Also see the entry 'DNS Servers'
in the Newbies Corner.
<BR>Now, for those who don't know you can get the IP/host by "whoising"
the user.
<BR>To do a whois on a user in mIrc, BitchX, IRCii, Pirch and some other
known IRC clients all you need to do is type /whois nickname
<BR>To whois someone in our raw connection (the one I taught you how to
establish at the beginning) type 'whois nickname' (without the quotes)
<BR>Here is what I get when I whois my self in the raw connection:
<BR>whois ^TCG^
<BR>:localhost 311 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ ~TCG thegod.actcom.co.il * :The Cyber God
<BR>:localhost 312 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ localhost :test server
<BR>:localhost 317 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ 9 932030074 :seconds idle, signon time
<BR>:localhost 318 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ :End of /WHOIS list.
<BR>Ok, before I explain what you got here, here is the format:
<BR>Format: :server-name raw-number sender target data.
<BR>Server-name is the server that gives you the data.
<BR>Raw-number is the ID of the data you got (it is used to determine what
data you are getting).
<BR>Sender: the senders nickname (you!!).
<BR>Target: The target (The nick you are whoising).
<BR>Data: The data.
<BR>Now here is an explanation on all the 4 lines
<BR>In the first one you see the user-name and the host of the user, you
also see his real name:
<PRE>~TCG thegod.actcom.co.il * :The Cyber God
&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ The user's real name (you can fake this :))
&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ The user host or IP
&nbsp; |
&nbsp; |_ The username (set by IdentD, will be explained later,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when followed by a '~' you see that the IdentD is NOT&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; running and the Ident (username) might be fake).</PRE>
&nbsp;
<PRE>The second line:
localhost :test server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ Comment about the server (set by the server admin)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ The server that user is connected to</PRE>
&nbsp;
<PRE>Third line:
9 932030074 :seconds idle, signon time
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_When the user signed in
|_ How many seconds has he been idle</PRE>
&nbsp;
<PRE>Last line:
:End of /WHOIS list.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ Shows you that there is no more data.</PRE>
Also, when users know your IP they can start almost any Denial of Service
(DoS) attack on your host like WinNuke (Arggg... Lame Lame Lame!!!) or
a lovely ping flood that will chew up all of your bandwidth, depending
on the attacker's bandwidth (for more info and more sophisticated DoS attacks,
see the DoS tutorial at blacksun.box.sk).

<P><A NAME="spoof"></A><B><U>[How to spoof / hide your identity on the
IRC]</U></B>
<BR>After seeing what users can find out about you, it is time to learn
how to hide your identity.

<P>There is no easy and lame way to do this. Here are the most knows ways:
FireWall, WinGate and a Bouncer aka (As Knows As) BNC.
<BR>We will start from the firewall.
<BR>The firewall we are talking about is software that runs on some machine
and is used to filter incoming packets (packets that arrive to the machine
which is running the firewall) and outgoing packets (packets that are sent
from the machine which is running the firewall). Some firewalls are not
configured very well and allow anyone to connect to them. The hard part
is to find a working one that will allow you to use it to connect through
it, and once you are connected, using it so users that will whois you or
dns you will see the firewall's IP! If, for example, there is a misconfigured
FireWall on the host firewall.someone.com, you can use it in mIRC, for
example, by starting the mIRC program (I use the newest version 5.6, go
download it at www.mirc.co.uk) and:
<BR>1. Click on the Files menu, then Options.
<BR>2. On the topmost label of the tree where you can see 'Connect', If
you see a '+' next to it click it. If you see a '-' go to the next step
<BR>3. Click on the sub-item Firewall (duh...)
<BR>4. Be sure the 'Use SOCKS firewall' checkbox is marked (has an 'X'
in it).
<BR>5. In the Hostname field, write the IP / Hostname of the firewall.
For example lets use firewall.someone.com
<BR>6. Leave the USER ID and PASSWORD empty, and make sure the port in
1080.
<BR>7. Click OK.
<BR>Now, next time you will type /server ... To connect to the IRC server
the connection will be relayed through the firewall, so if someone will
whois you he would see something like this:

<P>:localhost 311 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ ~TCG firewall.someone.com * :The Cyber God
<BR>:localhost 312 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ localhost :test server
<BR>:localhost 317 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ 9 932030074 :seconds idle, signon time
<BR>:localhost 318 ^TCG^ ^TCG^ :End of /WHOIS list.

<P>You can see that my host is NO LONGER thegod.actcom.co.il, instead it
is now firewall.someone.com!!
<BR>Now I am protected. You might be asking right now where to get the
firewalls hosts. One idea is go asking your friends. Other is going to
Altavista (www.altavista.com) and searching for "firewall AND list" and
stuff like that.

<P>Another way of spoofing your IP is a WinGate. WinGate is software for
Windows that is used to let several computers that are connected through
a local network of some sort to use one computer's Internet access. It
also allows you to fake your IP _EXACTLY_ the same way. After installing
WinGate, anyone will be able to use it if you don't configure it well (I
personally recommend using SyGate instead). To find Wingate addresses you
can ask your friends, run a Wingate scanner that will scan whole subnets
for Wingates or look for lists on the web.

<P>Note: newer versions of the IRC daemons will automatically check for
an open Wingate or a firewall, and if they will detect one they will kill
your session and might even K-Line (Ban the host from using the server/network)
the host as well.

<P>Now, on to the Bouncer (aka BNC) spoofing.
<BR>Bouncer is software that runs on Unix computers. If, for example, there
is a BNC on bnc.shell.com on port 1234, you can connect to it by typing:
/server bnc.shell.com 1234
<BR>After that you should be getting something like this:
<BR>-BNC- Please type your password via /quote pass
<BR>Crap... You need a password. If you know the password you have no problem.
Just type '/qoute pass password' (without the quotes), and replace 'password'
is your password.
<BR>If you don't know the password you need to ask the guy that gave you
the BNC (or you could always hack the server... ;) but this tutorial is
about IRC warfare, not hacking servers and getting passwords). You should
also ask him if it (the BNC) has vhosts. Vhosts are multiple IPs and hostnames
for the same BNC. If it has vhosts, you can set your active host by typing
'/quote vip the.host.name.here' (as you should be able to figure by now,
it is done without the quotes).

<P>After this you type '/conn server'. For example /conn irc.dal.net will
connect you to irc.dal.net with the bouncer's host.

<P>Note: unlike firewalls and badly configured Wingates, the server cannot
detect a BNC, so there is no chance you will be banned for using it.

<P><A NAME="bans/bypass"></A><B><U>[Bans and how to bypass them]</U></B>
<BR>Channel Operators might ban you after you have done something in their
channel that made them angry :( .
<BR>To bypass a ban you first need to know the ban type. There are a few
ban types:
<BR>1. nick!*@* - Bans you by your nickname. All you need to do is change
your nick (by typing /nick newnick, or in raw session NICK newnick) and
you can reenter the channel.
<BR>2. *!user@* - Bans you by your Ident (UserID). If your computer is
not running an IdentD daemon (A win9x with mIRC for example) you can easily
change your Ident by clicking on the File menu, selecting Options, opening
the 'Connect' sub-tree, clicking the IdentD label and changing the User
ID. If you are under a Unix / Linux machine that is already running an
IdentD daemon, you can't change it because it automatically sets your ident
username to your login name. To change this you need to logon to the IRC
through a Bouncer because bouncers fake you IdentD.
<BR>3. *!*@host - You are banned by your IP / host. All you need to do
is to connect through a firewall or a Wingate.
<BR>Some times the bans are more complex like ^TCG^!*@*.actcom.co.il.
<BR>This ban will prevent anyone named ^TCG^ with host that ends with .actcom.co.il
<BR>If you are interested here is the format:
<PRE>Nick!user@host / IP
&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ The IP or hostmask.
&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_ Your username. The IdentD sets this. When running IdentD daemon it
&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mostly not faked but when running windows or connection through a&nbsp;
&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bouncer it is probably faked.
&nbsp;|
&nbsp;|_The user nickname. If might also contain wildcards like *T*C*G*.
&nbsp;&nbsp; This will prevent anyone with the letters T, C and G (in this order)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; to join the channel.</PRE>

<PRE>Examples: ^TCG!*@*.actcom.co.il
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_________The server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | |_Your Ident user (defined as the wildcard '*', meaning ANYTHING)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_Your nickname</PRE>
As you probably know, channels have different modes. For example +o to
make a certain person an OP (Operator), +b to ban a person etc'. To set
a ban you type: /mode #Channel +b nick!user@host and to remove a ban you
type /mode #Channel -b nick!user@host
<BR>On a raw session you don't need the '/'.

<P><A NAME="nolikename"></A><B><U>[I don't like your nickname... / Getting
a user off the IRC]</U></B>
<BR>The easiest way to get a user off the IRC is using a program called
"Click2" for Windows.
<BR>If might not always work and it is considered extremely lame, but it
might work sometimes.
<BR>After you got this program, do the following:
<BR>1. Set the "Packets to:" option box to "Clinet"
<BR>2. In the Server textbox fill-in the TARGET server. You can figure
it out by doing a /whois or a /dns on the target's nickname.
<BR>3. In the Client textbox fill-in the TARGET IP address. You can also
figure this by doing a /whois or /dns on him but if he uses any spoofing
technique like a BNC or a Wingate it won't harm him even a bit (it may
harm the Wingate / Firewall / BNC, though).
<BR>4. Be sure that you set it to send 64 packets every 1000ms in the 2
textboxes at the end of the window.
<BR>5. The client start port should be 1024 and the stop 1500.
<BR>6. Now hit nuke....
<BR>This is what you will see if it worked and you were in a channel, and
the target in also in this channel:
<BR>*** Quits: ^TCG^ (Connection reset by peer)
<BR>(Or something likes this)

<P>The target should see something like this:
<BR>*** [10053] Software caused connection abort

<P>If it is not working, you won't see anything and he won't either. If
he is running some packet-logger that logs ICMP packets he will see your
IP but most users do not run these.

<P>Another lame way is to try winnuking the address. I won't explain here
how to do it and what winnuke is because it has nothing to do with this
tutorial (see R a v e N's DoS tutorial for Winnuke information, as well
as information on more sophisticated attacks).

<P>Here is a more complex way.
<BR>You will need a flood program like "Floods". (Ask me if you want it)
<BR>After running it or any other flooding script that is based on clone
loading you connect the clones to the target IRC server. (~6 clones should
do the job)
<BR>Before we continue, I want to explain you how this works.
<BR>Each user on the IRC got something called SendQ and RecvQ. They contain
the data the user is sending / receiving.
<BR>They also have a maximum value. If this value is achieved, the server
will automatically close their connection.
<BR>Flood programs and flood scripts load clones (computer-operated IRC
"users") and start sending lot of crap to the target nick, causing his
RecvQ to fill up and he should get disconnected :).

<P>So after you launched the program, you start flooding. I can't tell
you exactly how because there are lot of programs and I can't explain you
how every one works, but I can help you via my e-mail: talrun@actcom.co.il
<BR>There are also more advanced programs that support clone loading through
firewalls and Wingates. When a user loses his connection to the IRC because
of such an attack, everyone on every channel he was present on will see
the following:
<BR>*** Quits: ^TCG^ (Excess Flood)

<P>Another way of disconnecting a user from the IRC is exploiting a bug
in his OS. You need to determine his OS and start this attack on him. There
are lots of different types of attacks. To learn about them, read R a v
e N's DoS tutorial.

<P><A NAME="cought"></A><B><U>[Can I get caught and will I?]</U></B>
<BR>First of all, it depends on what you are going to do or already did.
<BR>When you are going to take over a channel for example, if you are doing
it without hiding your identity first (See previous chapter) you can get
caught but nothing will probably happen to you. You might receive a DoS
attack that can terminate your IRC session or lag you like hell. If you
are using a bouncer for example, you won't get caught for this. But if
you "click" someone and he logs the packets he can e-mail your ISP with
your IP and they might kill your account.

<P>If you are killing someone with a netsplit (See next chapter) you won't
get caught and nothing will happens to you since you haven't done anything
illegal.

<P>Also, it is good to know as much as possible about your target. If you
see some one that is named 'Ass^Hole' for example, you have no good reason
to go packet him or flood him. He might have access to an OC3 or a DS-3
line (Extremely fast connections to the Internet) and he might also detect
your attacks and start flooding you in return. Trust me, you don't want
this to happen. One day my T3 line got ping flooded from an OC3 line and
it stopped working for about 30 minutes. Just for your information, OC3
can transfer up to 255Mbit and a T3 can transfer up to 9Mbit (I think).
If such a line will flood your computer you don't stand a chance.

<P><A NAME="netsplit"></A><B><U>[What are netsplits and how can they help
me?]</U></B>
<BR>Large IRC networks consist of various servers. A NetSplit occurs when
a link between one of the servers and the others gets broken because of
lag or other reasons. All users that were connected to this channel will
be separated from the others as long as the netsplit occurs.
<BR>Therefore, lots of channels become empty, and get closed. When you
will join a channel that became empty, or you left only 1 user in the channel
and you will cycle it, there is a chance that you will obtain the channel
operator status (OP, @).
<BR>On a NetJoin (When the server relink to the entire network again) you
might still have the channel operator status. On new servers, you won't
get the operator status when the network is in a spilt mode, but if you
could find an old server or network you just might get lucky. Breaking
a connection between 2 servers by yourself is very difficult. You need
to pick 2 servers that are already lagged and start ping-flooding the target
server from a fast connection.
<BR>Once a netjoin occurs, it is recommended to have a war script (we'll
get to those) that will DeOP everyone on the channel so other OPs won't
be able to DeOP you.

<P>NetSplits can also let you disconnect a user from the IRC. Let's say
you want to disconnect a user named 'Lamer'. When a netsplit occurs, there
are two different possibilities:
<BR>1) The target user ('Lamer', in our case) was on the server that did
the netsplit and has left the IRC network, but will return once a netjoin
occurs (shouldn't take a lot of time).
<BR>2) The user is still on the network and has nothing to do with the
netsplit.
<BR>If number 1 occurs then all you need to do is connect to the network
using his nickname and wait for the netjoin. When the servers will re-link
they will see that there are 2 users with the same nickname. Such thing
cannot possibly happen, so one user must be killed. The user that was NOT
on the network, (which means he was on the splitted server) will probably
get killed. If option 2 occurs then all you can do is to put a clone (open
another IRC sesssion), connect to the splitted server and change your nick
to his nick. When the servers will rejoin there is a small chance that
he will get killed, so cross your fingers. :)

<P>Now, for the 1,000,000$ question: how do I detect a netsplit? You can
detect a netsplit if the user(s) quit message is "Server1 Server2". For
example:
<PRE>Lamar has quit IRC (irc.magic.com irc.freei.net)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_Server2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |_Server1</PRE>
This message tells you that there is a split between irc.magic.com and
irc.freei.net
<BR>The second server (Server2) is the server that left the net.

<P><A NAME="takeover"></A><B><U>[Channel Takeovers]</U></B>
<BR>Channel takeovers are used to take a channel from a user, and prevent
him from reentering the channel or gaining operator status in the channel.
The first thing you need to do is to get ops. Here are 4 ways to get ops:
<BR>1. Via a NetSplit. (might take a lot of time)
<BR>2. Asking one of the ops to let you be an op (Who knows? You might
get lucky).
<BR>3. Running a bot on your computer or on a shell account and telling
the other ops that it is online 24 hours a day, and ask them to op it.
They might do it, then tell the bot to op you.
<BR>4. You can always lure the other ops into giving you op by telling
them that you will advertise their channel and bring them users and you
might earn the ops status.
<BR>You can do nothing without the OP status. Here is what you do after
you got an op and you want to close they're channels:
<BR>1. First, mass de-op all the users so they won't kick or ban you. There
are a lot of scripts out there that will do this for you.
<BR>2. Then place a ban on *!*@*
<BR>3. Mass-Kick the channel (also with a script)
<BR>4. After this set the following modes: +smilk 1 1 (you type /mode #Channel
+smilk 1 1)
<BR>5. You took over the channel! :)
<BR>There is a problem with this, when you will leave the channel he will
get empty and then closed. The only solution for this is placing a 24/7
(24 hours a day, 7 days a week) bot in the channel. If channel services
are available on this network (Like in DALnet), you can register the channel
if no one else have done this already.
<BR>If you took over a registered channel, you will have a problem keeping
it because Channel Services can give the channel back to its legal owner
with no problem.

<P><A NAME="ruin"></A><B><U>[How to completely ruin a channel]</U></B>
<BR>Here are some possible ways to completely ruin a channel:
<BR>1) Turning the channel into an invite-only channel, so only people
who were invited (to invite people, type /invite nick) can join.
<BR>2) Making the channel password-protected.
<BR>3) Making sure that you are the only OP in the channel and then turning
the channel into moderated mode and then mass-devoicing everyone. In moderated
mode, only voiced users (people with a little + in the beginning of their
nick. To voice people, do /mode #channel +v nick or -v to devoice) can
talk. That way, users will be able to see who is on the channel (note:
you can see who's on a channel without joining it by typing /names #channel),
but they won't be able to chat, and they will have to listen to you...

<P><A NAME="raw"></A><B><U>[Some expansion about RAW sessions]</U></B>
<BR>Too lazy to read RFC ?
<BR>Well, this is the "SUMMARY" of rfc1459 (IRC Protocol). Hopefully after
reading this you'll have better understanding of how the protocol work
(hey... don't just use it... try to understand how it work). Yeah... this
is also how some people spoof their IP by telneting from some restricted
shell account with no IRC client access.

<P>[Connecting to the IRC daemon]

<P>Telnet/netcat (yep... we're gonna use a raw socket) to the IRC port
(6667/6668..etc) of the IRC server.

<P>eg &lt;:> telnet irc.dal.net 6667

<P>Send your nick &amp; username to be recognized after u got connected
using the user command in this form "user&nbsp;<username><hostname><servername><realname>".

<P>eg &lt;:> user nobody localhost localhost :I'm nobody nick nobody

<P>-------------------------[!! NOTE !!]-------------------------
<BR>At any time if your receive anything like this
<BR>ping :1234567 &lt;-- The sequence number change all the time
<BR>or
<BR>ping :192.0.0.1 &lt;-- Some IP address

<P>You must send back the number with a pong
<BR>eg &lt;:> pong :1234567
<BR>or
<BR>pong :192.0.0.1

<P>If you don't pong back, you'll be disconnected with a ping timeout error.
<BR>---------------------[!! END OF NOTE !!]-------------------

<P>[Exploring some basic commands]

<P>Ok, after the nick &amp; user commands you can start chatting now. Type
join #channel (Without the /) to join #channel.

<P>(Yea... most commands you use in your BitchX or mIRC client can also
be
<BR>used here too...just don't include the /
<BR>eg: part #channel
<BR>quit :I'm out
<BR>etc... )

<P>To send your message to a channel, use the privmsg command.

<P>eg &lt;:> privmsg #channel : Hi guys...Sup? (Dont forget the ":" if
you are going to send more then one word)

<P>This will send "Hi guys...Sup?" to #channel

<P>To send a private message to a user:
<BR>eg &lt;:> privmsg nickname : HI ya

<P>This will send "HI ya" to nickname.

<P>To set a mode on a channel you simply type mode #channel mode.
<BR>For example, MODE #Channel +b 192.114.*.* will ban everyone that they're
IP begin with 192.114.

<P>[Fun stuff to do]

<P>If you get something like this ":nick!user@ip-address PRIVMSG your-nick
:_VERSION_"
<BR>this means that nick is trying ctcp/version you. This command is used
to find out your version.
<BR>Send the version back using the NOTICE command... it could be anything
you want.

<P>eg : NOTICE nick :_VERSION Telnet version 0.1 :) _

<P>This will send "Telnet version 0.1 :)" as the version reply.

<P><A NAME="ctcp"></A><B><U>[Faking /CTCP Replies]</U></B>

<P>Now many of you guys chat and have various people always doing{Client
for Client Protocol} CTCP replies, ie.&nbsp; VERSION, TIME, FINGER, PING&nbsp;&nbsp;
replies on you. These replies can get you in a lot of trouble, mainly its
a way for people to gather information about you then start up an attack.&nbsp;
Now it is time to change the replies your mirc will give in a way to cause
the other end to be fooled. Well this topic has been covered by many writers
and warscript developers, but many don't know about changing the replies
to their advantage, well look no further, here we go!

<P>One of the most devistating attacks can come from a VERSION reply.

<P>To do a ctcp&nbsp; version reply&nbsp; on a user, all you have to do
is type:
<BR>"/ctcp &lt;nick> VERSION " This will return the nick's irc client.
Now you may ask why is that important? Well lets say your using mirc 5.7x
which suffers from heap overflow of 217 bytes, and 5.8 heap overflow of
226 bytes&nbsp; by knowing your version an attacher already knows which
operating system your using and a version, so they can hack you without
a trojan and you won't know it happened.
<BR>Lets kill the version reply to either give a fake reply or no reply
at all so they can sit there waiting, lol.
<BR>Okay you will need a hex editor for this, I recomment Hiew, get it
<A HREF="http://protocols.cjb.net">here!</A>
<BR>-make a backup of your mirc32.exe.
<BR>-install hiew, load it up, once you have clicked mirc32.exe now you
will see some garbage, click F7 that should popup the search box, type
in VERSION you should be able to find the reply something like mIRC32 v5.8
K.Mardam-Bey. Now just delete the reply. If you have trouble doing it with
Hiew then get another hex editor, there are many around but its the best.
So save and exit. Now you can chose to have no Version reply to make your
attacker suffer from waiting when there isn't going to be a reply or you
can fake your reply to trick him.
<BR>Lets trick the attacker:

<P>Load up you mirc, then goto&nbsp; the tools menu, then click " Remote
". There you should see a box,
<BR>now simply write this mini script,
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well now the attacker will keep waiting and waiting.

<P>Lets fake some more,
<BR>Another ctcp reply that can be of usage is /ctcp &lt;nick> PING
<BR>This reply of your ping will tell the attacker&nbsp; the speed of your
connection and if your lagging, wink wink he might want to do a dos attack
and boot you, so lets fake the reply to our advantage.
<BR>Same as above write this mini script in our tools, then "remote"

Usually I have mine set to 1 sec , but you can make it funny like 690263165

which will send the other user, your local time/date. This is very bad
cause if your busy trying to bounce your ip over wingates and proxys and
now your ip is somewhere in Asia, and someone does ctcp TIME then they
will know your true&nbsp; location in the world, which can hurt your spoofing

<P><A NAME="editorial"></A><B><U>[Editorial - IRC wars, another perspective]</U></B>
<BR>Note: Most of this is taken from an article that was written by Ntd
(ntd@mirc.net). I feel that this article has the best perspective about
the IRC wars.
<BR>Note 2: If you are a newbie and you think IRC wars are a great form
of hacking, and doing complex attacks you might want to skip this chapter
and read it another time.

<P><B>IRC WAR? A LOAD OF SILLY NUKES</B>
<BR>Right, first things first, nukes - or properly, Denial of Service (DoS)
attacks - are technically nothing to do with IRC war. They operate directly
from the attacker to the victim's IP, and IRC comes into it only inasmuch
as it gives the attacker a ready source of IP addresses to attack, and
perhaps a "motive" for doing it (e.g, "they banned me!"). But, attackers
could just as easily collect IPs from services such as ICQ (which, incidentally,
has to be one of the most idiotically insecure protocols ever invented,
yet many people who bemoan IRC attack happily run ICQ, and probably don't
even check the option to hide their IP which is useless anyway because
there are lot of patches that will always show you the IP even if the user
chose to hide it).

<P><B>IRC WAR DOESN'T HELP IMPROVE SECURITY</B>
<BR>Surely the stupidest argument against IRC war, is that unlike other
forms of hacking, it does not help anybody because it doesn't contribute
to increased security. There is a mass of evidence showing quite clearly
that this is not the case. Why did Microsoft release a winsock that was
not vulnerable to the port 139 OOB nuke? Because that nuke became so widely
abused. Why do current versions of mIRC have an option to only enable the
identd server during connection? Because mIRC 5.3 had an ident exploit
with which mIRC could be crashed. Why, in fact, have flood attacks become
so obsolete? Because ircds now contain anti-flood code written directly
in response to flood abuse. Of course these attacks are irritating and
disruptive at the time, but in the long term they have undoubtedly led
to more secure code in operating systems, clients and irc daemons.

<P><B>IRC WAR IS NOT REAL HACKING</B>
<BR>Again, this stems from a misunderstanding of what IRC war is. Essentially
there are two types: TCP/IP attacks (ICMP nuke, smurf, fraggle, ping of
death) and ircd based attacks (nick collisions, lag collisions, serverops,
hacking o:lines, bogus bans). While the first category are almost exclusively
"lame cracking" (that is, the user needs only to download a program and
can then use it without any actual knowledge), the second category is more
ambiguous. I know one person who finds many exploits by working with the
ircd code (which is of course almost always free for download) - and finding
bugs by working with the source is as "real" as hacking can get. Within
a few days of their implementation he found ways of bypassing the ircnet
ircd patches designed to protect against open socks servers and deliberate
nick collisions. He even found a method by which a normal client could
completely crash a server remotely. And what did he do with this knowledge...?

<P><B>DOS ATTACKS</B>
<BR>Yes, they are illegal, and yes they are disruptive. Furthermore, many
DoS attacks affect many more people than those targeted, the most obvious
example being the smurf attack. I am one of a group of friends who run
a few of the biggest channels on ircnet, and these channels are regularly
attacked by war groups intent on taking them. I make no exaggeration when
I say that several times a week, if not everyday, members of the original
channel opers complain that they are being smurfed by members of groups
attempting to take the channel. These smurf attacks are capable of taking
down entire ISPs and that IRC warriors recklessly use these attacks against
single users just to take an irc channel is utterly inexcusable in my opinion.

<P><B>MOTIVATION</B>
<BR>While there are some IRC warriors / hackers like the individual I described
above, it is sadly true that there are many more who are acting from more
dubious motives. To the people who resort to floods, nukes and such tools
just because they are banned from channels, I say: you need to get out
more. What, then is my basic point? My conclusion is that IRC abuse and
hacking is like any other branch of hacking - it ranges from the incredibly
basic and lame to the actually quite skilled and beneficial. At the one
end are the classic 13 year old hax0r wannabes with their CLICK.EXE, and
I am in no way suggesting these people's behaviour should be excused or
tolerated. However, I urge you all to be aware that at the other end of
the scale exist talented, knowledgeable hackers discovering and revealing
bugs in clients, OSes and ircds by a variety of methods and in doing so
making IRC more secure for all of us.

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="packet"></A><B><U>[Some intresting articles by Packet]</U></B>

<P>=[Ping Flooding]=

<P>1. =What is a ping?=
<BR>A ping is a small file (often 32 bytes) that is sent to another computer
online,
<BR>in which the other computer replys. Basicly it is saying "hello" to
another
<BR>computer. With this is also shows how long it took for the ping to
get there
<BR>and back.

<P>2. =So why is this usefull to me?=
<BR>Well it can and it can not be usefull. If you are going to play a game
like
<BR>quake/quake2 on a server, the faster the ping gets there and back the
better.
<BR>Also, if you are on a fast connection you can nock people of there
ISP
<BR>temperarily. This is called ping flooding, and can work very well.
The best
<BR>thing to flood with is a T1 or better. Even if you don't have more
than a
<BR>28.8 you can lag or kill someone. Here is an example of how ping works

<P><in dos prompt>
<BR>C:\ping 24.131.12.124

<P>this would send a few 32byte packets to that host. Now, this won't do
much
<BR>by itself...but there are more features to pinging that make it very
usefull.
<BR>this is the command I often use

<P>C:\ping -l 2800 -t -w 2000 24.131.12.124
<BR>(good for 28.8 users)

<P>-l is the size of the packet to send, generaly you want to keep trying
higher
<BR>numbers till you find the very most there connection can take....soon
they
<BR>will be to lagged to do much, or get killed. -w is how long it waits
till it
<BR>decides to time out.... -t keeps pinging the IP untill you hit CTRL+Break

<P>there are some other cool switches like -n wich echo floods them, and
-v
<BR>witch specifys the Terms Of Service

<P>=[Net Splits]=

<P>1. =[What is a NetSplit]=
<BR>The large irc servers work, is they link together to provide less lag
and a
<BR>local server to many people. They link together so that people can
talk and
<BR>do what ever and not have to be on the same server. What a netsplit
is, is
<BR>when one server is lagged enough it breaks off from the rest of the
servers
<BR>then becoming its own stand alone server untill it merges again.

<P>2. =[Why Does this matter?]=
<BR>Well it can and it can't matter....It is possible to take over a channel
<BR>through netsplits. So it can matter if you want to protect yourself
from
<BR>this, or do it yourself.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>3. =[How do I protect myself?]=
<BR>The only way is to have netsplit protection. Alot of people do not
like this
<BR>script, and I do not recomend using it unless you think someone is
trying to
<BR>take your channel. When servers merge it trys to restore the settings
as it
<BR>was before the split. So if you were a channel operator the server
would OP
<BR>you, reset the modes etc etc. When someone takes a channel by a netsplit
they
<BR>get opped by the server, so the script deops anyone who is opped by
the server.
<BR>If you do use this script, make sure people can op themselves automaticly
by
<BR>sending you a message. ...

<P>4. =[How do I take a channel through this?]=
<BR>First you need a link looker, (which comes with this script). What
a link
<BR>looker does is search for servers that are about to or have broken
off. When
<BR>you find a server that has broken off, you need to quickly join that
server
<BR>and go into the channel you want to take over. If no one else is on
that server
<BR>you will be a channel operator. But this is not all you have to do,
because
<BR>when the servers merge again it will deop you. You need to run the
Dysnch script
<BR>which will fill the channel with bans and diffrent modes. Hopefully
it will
<BR>screw up the already screwed channel enough that when the merge happens
it
<BR>thinks you were a channel operator and you keep your OPS. Then you
need to
<BR>quickly run the takeover script so that none of the netsplit protection
(if
<BR>there are any) scripts deop you.

<P>=[Advanced Nuking]=

<P>Nuking is fun for the whole family, but sometimes it's not just "wham
bam thank you ma'am". On
<BR>occasion, it requires you to be a little creative to successfully nuke
someone. hopefully
<BR>we will give you some ideas on how to become a pheared nuker.

<P>** Open ports:
<BR>In order to become a successful nuker, you must learn to find as much
information about your
<BR>target as possible. One of the most important elements to nuking is
finding the right ports
<BR>to nuke. the default IRC server ports are 6660-6669, with 6667 being
the most commonly used.
<BR>One thing you may discover throughout your nuking 'career' is that
most servers offer different
<BR>ports that are open for IRCing. The easiest way to find out the open
ports is to check the
<BR>Message Of the Day, for 90% of all IRC servers will list their open
ports in the motd. To get
<BR>the message of the day simply type '/motd irc.server.net'. This will
display the motd and allow
<BR>you to find the open ports (usually). Now you can nuke these ports,
increasing your chances of
<BR>success.

<P>** Their Connection:
<BR>Another thing you may want to do is find out whether your target is
on a shell account, or a
<BR>dial-up account. Under normal circumstances, dial-up users are easier
to nuke then shell accounts
<BR>for reasons we won't go into right now. To find out which they are
using, simply take the last
<BR>part of their IP and try to visit to the ISP's homepage. Again, there
are many servers that
<BR>will describe their services on their web-page. Usually, if their ip
is two or three legible
<BR>words only interupted by a period, then it is a shell. For instance,
<BR>"jkrondike@mainsys.postex.net" would most likely be a shell account,
while
<BR>"yourmom@modem29.er.actil.net" is usually a dial-up.

<P>** Nuking Shell Users:
<BR>If you're using windows, you should download a program that will allow
you to finger a server.
<BR>Cyberkit is a good program, for it has Ping, Finger, Traceroute, etc.
<BR>get it at http://www.ping.be/cyberkit/cyber.zip, or go find one of
your own. there are hundreds
<BR>to choose from. (no we're not being endorsed by cyberkit, it's just
a kickass proggie)
<BR>Most shell account users will login from a dial-up account, and if
finger is running on their
<BR>shell, it should display the dial-up IP address. Finger the server
and once you know this, use
<BR>your nuker to disconnect them from their shell by replacing the IRC
server with their shell
<BR>account address, and use the IP you found through finger as the client.
Use ports 22 24 as the
<BR>server ports, in place of 6660 6669. Port 23 is the default telnet
port, so nuking from 22 to 24
<BR>will effictivly disconnect them from their shell account. this usually
causes your target to
<BR>quit irc with "Where did my controling terminal go?" quit message.
it's pretty funny when it
<BR>works.
