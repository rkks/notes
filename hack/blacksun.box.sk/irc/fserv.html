  <br>
  So you've been on IRC for a while and you've stumbled across a channel for fserving, 
  but now your lost. What is all this? So you ask around, and of course, no one 
  helps (one habit of the IRC crowd). So you finally figure part of it out and 
  get in one (I'll get to the technicalities later). But now you're really lost. 
  You are officially up shit creek without a paddle. So you message the host a 
  question and he bans you. As you bow your head and say &quot;fuck&quot;, remember, 
  some things in cyberspace aren't user friendly. Don't get pissed, just learn.<br>

  <br>
  Like most things in life, this tutorial suggests that you understand certain 
  aspects of the subject matter or common components of it. Upon writing this 
  tutorial I realize that many people reading this are the absolute beginners. 
  What I mean by this is that some people reading this learned of Fserving and 
  the advantages of it, so they got mIRC, but they don't really understand how 
  to use mIRC in the first place. So this tutorial suggest that you have an understanding 
  of mIRC and the ideals behind it. Also that you understand your operating systems 
  file structure (i.e. The Windows hard drive is drive C:\). And finally that 
  you are pretty knowledgable of computers and software. You don't have to have 
  the expertise of a hacker or programmer, but you do need some computer know-how. 
  You also must be using mIRC, which is what I use Now if you've got all of that 
  covered, please continue.</p>
<p> <b><a name="5"></a>D. Viewing this Tutorial</b></p>
<p> I wrote this tutorial in NoteTab Light, which is one of the best text editors 
  on the planet (www.notetab.com - SHAMELESS Plug, I know). So obviously viewing 
  it in it will work fine, and it will look fine. Windows NotePad will also work 
  fine, as will WordPad. If it doesn't look right in whatever editor/viewer you 
  use, then I really don't know what to say. Just use NotePad, WordPad, or NoteTab 
  Light. Though it should look fine in anything that reads ASCII text. <br>

  <font size="4"><b><a name="6"></a>II. STRUCTURE OF AN FSERV</b></font><br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="7"></a>A. How an Fserv Works</b><br>
  <br>
  Now that is something that even the most experienced Fserv hosts don't even 
  understand. And to use one and understand what's going on, you do need to understand 
  how it works. Now this is more theoretical than I'd like, but it's necessary. 
  When someone sets up an fserv (which we'll get to later) all they use is a SCRIPT, 
  which is just a few files that modifies mIRC's appearance and how it works. 
  And what all these files do, is take the hosts place and do what the user wants 
  based on the commands that he/she types. So when someone types the appropriate 
  trigger for the fserv, all the script does is go &quot;Holy shit! He typed the 
  trigger!&quot;, then it opens an everyday, nothing out of the normal, DCC Chat 
  window with the person. Then the user types commands and the script does what 
  it's told. So basically, all the script does is take your place. So, where someone 
  would say to you &quot;Hey send me that Lynyrd Skynyrd mp3!&quot;, the person 
  says &quot;get freebird.mp3&quot; to the script and the script sends it. You 
  see, computers are real dumb, so that is why it has commands and the script 
  uses these commands to do what you could, but faster and more efficiently. Now 
  if that's a little daunting, don't worry. After you learn how to use one, it 
  will either make sense or not matter. If you set up your own fserv it will make 
  sense though.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="8"></a>B. Common Commands</b><br>
  <br>
  Now some commands differ from script to script, but there is a common set that 
  all scripts use. Now, if you are familiar with DOS, then these will make sense. 
  One syntax note: when a word appears between &lt;these&gt; , then that means 
  you fill the space basically. So if the tutorial says &quot; get &lt;filename&gt; 
  &quot; Then you should replace filename with the appropriate word (So if you 
  wanted picture.jpg then you'd type get picture.jpg). And to keep this 'beginner 
  friendly' I chose only the bare-bones commands. Please continue.<br>
  <br>

</table>
<p>Now to understand what the user/host's computer connection is, I'm going to 
  have to explain a little bit of the fserv setup process. Now, when someone (the 
  host) sets up an fserv, they edit and configure the script, which is just basiclally 
  changing options. And one of those options is a ROOT DIRECTORY. The root directory 
  is the first directory. So if his root directory is C:/Folder/First/ Then the 
  first directory you're in when you get on his fserv is C:/Folder/First/ . So 
  when you are changing directories and such, then you are changing directories 
  on his machine. So basically, the script is just letting you know what's available 
  (what folders you have accesst to) and let's you make your decisions on what 
  files to get. You see, there is no real server involved. All it is is a script 
  which acts like one by accpting commands and sending and getting files. Now 
  on to sending and getting.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="9"></a>C. Uploading and Downloading Information</b><br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="10"></a>1. The Credit System</b><br>
  <br>
  The Credit System is one of the largest and most intriguing aspects of fserving. 
  It really is one of the few things, besides just plain generosity, that would 
  make someone want to become a host. But what is it about? Well let's suppose 
  you get on a fserv that deals with mp3s (for legalities sake, let's say 'legal' 
  mp3s). Ok, so the guy who hosts the thing doesn't just want to give out mp3s, 
  I mean why would he? It's simply human nature to want something in return. So 
  that's where the Credit System comes in. You see, if the guy's fserv script 
  uses the Credit System, then he can 'charge' for the mp3s. And I don't mean 
  money, I mean, well, credit. You see, here's how it works. There are three kinds 
  of fservs, all of which have some sort of Credit System (I'll get into each 
  one in detail later). Now, with the Credit System, the hosts sets 2 things: 
  STARTING CREDIT and RATIO. Both of these are very important to how your fserv 
  experience goes (and which fservs you use). Ok, lets start with Starting Credit. 
  Starting Credit, is simply, how much Credit you start with. Much like how much 
  money you start with in a game of Monopoly. Now remember, all values are in 
  BYTES, not KILOBYTES. So if the Starting Credit is 1000000 , then you start 
  with a MEGABYTE worth of credit. So what is Credit for, you ask. Well, if you 
  want a mp3 thats 3 megs, then you need 3 megs of Credit (which is 3000000 in 
  byte/credits form). So how do you get that credit? Uploading, which I'll get 
  into later. Now lets get into Ratio, which is just as important as Starting 
  Credit, if not more. Now what Ratio is, is a way for a hosts to allow more credit 
  to be given to uploaders. Why this was even thought of in the first place is 
  not even known, but it's still implemented in almost every script. Now, ratio 
  is represented by the same means as in Mathematics, with 2 numbers seperated 
  by a colon (2:3). Now how it works out in lamens terms is different. Ok, this 
  can be confusing. If a fserv has a 1:2 ratio, than that basically means for 
  every byte that I upload I get 2 bytes back. So, if I upload a 500k picture 
  (equal to 500000 bytes/credits) to a this fserv, then I get 1 meg of credit 
  back (equal to 1000000 bytes/credits). The same works for different ratios such 
  as 1:4. Except, in this case for every byte uploaded, you get 4 bytes back, 
  and so on. Now, what about LEECH? If you've been to the fserving channels before, 
  you've heard that term tossed around. Well, it's actually simple. Let's suppose 
  your on a Mp3 fserv, and it says in his RULES MESSAGE that he'll give Leech 
  for an Mp3 of a certain song. So you know that you've got it, so you upload 
  it. Then he'll give you Leech, which means you have infinite Credits. Basically, 
  Leech is like being able to have anything in a store for free. There are also 
  LEECH FSERVS, which I'll get into later. <br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="11"></a>2. Uploading </b><br>
  <br>
  Now here's a topic that evaded me for a long time. First of all, you should 
  know by now what you upload for (Answer: Credit), and what happens when you 
  upload (The file gets sent to the hosts computer). But how do you upload? Well, 
  it's actually very simple. If the script takes the hosts place, but pretty much 
  does the same things, then if you wanted to upload to the fserv, then all you 
  have to do is do a DCC Send to the fserv! It's that simple. And after your file 
  is done sending, then you get your credit. Always in that order. Now, there 
  is some ethics and manners involved with this, but I'll get into that in a bit.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="12"></a>3. Downloading </b><br>
  <br>
  Also a very simple topic. Ok, basically, you get a file by using the command 
  &quot;get &lt;filename&gt;&quot; (without the quotes). But first, you must have 
  enough Credit. Which you do by uploading, of course. So this is a simpler subject 
  and the very essense of fserving. Now, there is a limit to how much you download 
  at a time. It depends on the fserv though. This will be discussed when I teach 
  about hosting your own fserv later on in the tutorial.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="13"></a>D. Information on the Types of Scripts</b><br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="14"></a>1. Byte Ratio Scripts</b><br>
  <br>
  The most popular of the Scripts simply because the host is guaranteed something 
  in return. Very simple, because it uses the exact Credit System I described 
  above. Where the Ratio describes bytes sent:bytes returned. This is the Script 
  type of choice for Mp3, Video, Porn, etc. hosts. As said before, this type Script 
  is used anytime that the host wants something in return for supplying everyone 
  with these files. Thus, it is claimed as the King of Scripts.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="15"></a>2. File Ratio Scripts</b><br>
  <br>
  A very bizarre type of Script. Not many people use it anymore because of the 
  high potential of 'rip-offs'. It uses the same Credit System with the exception 
  that instead of the Ratio being bytes sent:bytes returned , it's files sent:files 
  returned. So you can easily see what the potential for getting 'ripped' is. 
  For example, let's use that mp3 fserv again. So, this mp3 fserv is using a File 
  Ratio Script with a 1:3 ratio. So after someone uploads a file (yeah, any file) 
  then he then gets permission to download 3 files. Yeah, bytes/credit has nothing 
  to do with anything. The problem is that I could upload 2k picture and then 
  get 3 files for basically nothing. These are rare these days, but I suppose, 
  are still used in trusted enviornments - Private Channels where only trusted 
  people are given access. Though in most other cases, these aren't used that 
  often. Surprisingly Leech Scripts are way more common.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="16"></a>3. Leech Scripts</b><br>
  <br>
  These are surprisingly popular, though not as popular as the Byte Ratio Scripts. 
  These are just as they say, completely Leeched to everyone. So there are no 
  Ratios, no Uploading, no Starting Credits, and definately no ways of getting 
  Leech (I mean you already have it!). These also usually come with another feature, 
  not often found on other types of Scripts, QUEUES. Very simply, Queueing is 
  a way that you can send out minimal files while still giving them all they need. 
  Basically a Queue is a 'slot' that, once the maximum amount of simultaneous 
  sends has been met, will hold the file 'til a slot opens up, then send it. So 
  if a fserv only allows 2 Simulataneous downloads and there's 2 files being sent, 
  and I try to get a file, the script will put it in a Queue Slot, which then 
  will send it when one of the sends are done. So it basically holds it until 
  it can send it. If you don't understand, you will when you use one. It's still 
  a very nice feature. These Scripts are usually found in any fservs that deal 
  with smaller files like Text Files (*.txt). They're also found in fservs that 
  deal with emulation and any type of fserv where the host doesn't want anything 
  in return.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="17"></a>III. PREVENTION OF GETTING BANNED</b></font><br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="18"></a>A. Proper Fserv Manners</b><br>
  <br>
  You will soon learn that there is no worse feeling than being banned. As an 
  experienced user and host, I understand both sides. But unfortunately, the user 
  must follow the host's rules. And that's really understandable cosidering that 
  hosting a fserv is a service and a major pain in the ass sometimes, so the user 
  really isn't a priority. And that's why most hosts don't even pay attention 
  to their fservs, cause they don't wanna deal with the users (Though I don't 
  like that fact). So, as a user, if you don't follow the rules you will be kicked/banned 
  so you need to learn some fserv ethics which will help you in the future. Hell, 
  if you follow, you may not be banned ever again.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="19"></a>B. Staying on a Host's Good Side</b></p>
<p> Now I don't wanna come off as saying that you've gotta kiss the host's ass. 
  That's not it at all. You see, the whole user-host relationship is easy to understand 
  - IT SHOULDN'T EXIST! It's very simple, don't talk to the host unless absolutely 
  necessary. Don't ask a bunch of questions and don't voice any opinions. They 
  just don't care. If the host talks to you, then of course, talk back, but you 
  shouldn't be an asshole and complain about the unfixable - Speed, messed up 
  Sends, etc. And never under any circumstances, argue with the host, because 
  it won't last long. As soon as you say something like that you will get banned. 
  Hosts don't wanna hear it. The whole act of complaining to a host will be discussed 
  next, but you really shouldn't have much to complain about except something 
  being wrong with the Script (like not getting credit for uploads, nothing sending, 
  etc.). It comes down to this: The host is doing you a service by hosting the 
  fserv so you really don't have that much room to run your mouth to him. And 
  most aren't open to open to constructive criticism or any suggestions so just 
  do your business and leave. It's almost like prostitution: You upload (Pay), 
  then you download (Fuck),then you leave. So do your business and leave. And 
  follow their Rules Message, that's why it's there. <br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="20"></a>C. The Proper Way to Send Complaints</b><br>
  <br>
  Ahhhh.... The infamous art of Customer Service. Basically this boils down to 
  this: Never complain about the unfixable. If the connections slow, wait longer. 
  If the sends aren't working, try again. Just don't complain. I guarantee ban 
  if you complain. And it's understandable cause you're just being an asshole. 
  But if there is something seriously wrong, like the Script isn't working right, 
  then you have every right to complain, and do so. But make sure something is 
  really wrong, and you're not doing something. But if you feel something is seriously 
  wrong, then msg the host and tell them. They may get pissed if nothing's wrong, 
  but they'll appreciate it if something is really wrong. So just use good judgement 
  and avoid DCC Chat. Just go into the channel they're in and double click on 
  their handle. Most hosts like it better that way. Or you could try it in the 
  fserv windows, though they may not pay any attention to it. Well use good judgement 
  and you'll learn how to do it perfectly with experience. One last note, when 
  you tell them you think something is wrong, choose your words carefully; don't 
  just blather on about how it's not sending and act like it's there fault, just 
  say nicely and politely that you believe something isn't right and ask if they 
  know what is wrong, if they don't, then well, fuck it.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="21"></a>IV. HOW TO SET UP YOUR OWN FSERV</font></b></p>
<p> <b><a name="22"></a>A. Selecting the Appropriate Script</b><br>
  <br>
  When setting up your own Fserv you have to know what the purpose is, then choose 
  your Script. For example, a porn picture fserv would most likely want to get 
  more pictures. Thus, it would use a Byte Ratio Script. Though, a Edgar Allan 
  Poe E-Book fserv would most likely be a Leech Script because of the low byte 
  size and the fact that those are public domain in the first place. So you should 
  choose your Script carefully. Next, I will examine 2 of the most popular Scripts, 
  and one I just like.</p>
<p> <b><a name="23"></a>1. Installing mIRC Scripts</b></p>
<p> I understand that some people do not understand how to install a script. First 
  of all, there are two different forms that you get the files: Either a zipped 
  archive (*.zip) or an executable file (*.exe). Now when you open either one, 
  they should say where they are going to put the files. Now, you have the option 
  to change this location, which is suggested if the files are in a .zip . So, 
  once you've got the files on your machine, all you do is copy mirc32.exe and 
  mlink32.exe into the directory where you put the Script files. So if you put 
  the files in C:/Script/ , Then you've past mirc32.exe and mlink32.exe inot C:/Script/

  <b><a name="24"></a>B. Setting Up the Script</b></p>
<p> Here I'll explain the basic setup process of the before-mentioned Scripts: 
  Panzer, Polaris, and Sphoo. These three Scripts represent each type, Panzer 
  is a File Ratio and Leech Script, Polaris is a Leech Script, and Sphoo can be 
  all three. I'll also include a small review of each in the following sections. 
  I do suggest reading each one, or at least Panzer, then the one your using, 
  being that I cover most of the Script setup procedure in Panzer and many of 
  the configurations/terms are the same in the other Scripts.</p>
<p> <b><a name="25"></a>1. Setting Up Panzer</b><br>
  <br>
  Now this one is so easy, and that's why it's the most popular Script on earth. 
  It's a Byte Ratio Script and uses a friendly user interface that rocks. But 
  first head to <a href="http://members.tripod.com/%7EArntS/" target="_blank">http://members.tripod.com/~ArntS/</a> 
  and get the latest version. Ok, when you run mIRC with the Script there's a 
  good bit of graphical change, but you can figure that out. All I'm doing is 
  helping you set it up. First go to a button called &lt;&lt;Panzer&gt;&gt; at 
  the top and choose Fserve Setup. Then right click and choose choose 'Setup/Change', 
  then choose '1'st Time Setup'. Then change the options to your liking. You should 
  be able to figure out each of them. Note that Ratio is set with a single number, 
  1:2 is 2 , 1:3 is 3, etc. Also, the Root Directory is the initial or home directory 
  that has all the folders/files of your fserv. Basically for further configuration 
  just use the &lt;&lt;Panzer&gt;&gt; button and look for the options. The only 
  other necessary configurations is Starting Credit, Rules MSG, and Advertising. 
  I'll walk you through them. But keep in mind that I am considering that you 
  already have the 'Fserv Setup' window open and your right clicking to get to 
  the options. Now we setup the Starting Credit. It should be under &quot;Setup/Change&quot;, 
  &quot;Change&quot; , &quot;Starting Credit&quot;. Keep the number at least 5 
  digits. Just to make it look useful, and type FREE CREDIT to use Panzer as a 
  Leech Script. The Rules Msg is also very simple. Ok, the Rules Msg options are 
  under &quot;Setup/Change&quot; then Rules Msg. You'll notice there are three 
  options: Change, Enable, and Disable. Ok, if you want a Rules Message (which 
  you should know what it is by now), then choose Enable, if you don't think you 
  need one, choose Disable. Now, notice that all your options are viewable in 
  the &quot;Fserv Setup&quot; window. Ok, so if you chose 'Enable' then now go 
  back to the Rules Msg options and choose 'Change'. Now Notepad (or your default 
  text editor) will pop up and you just have to write your Rules message. I'll 
  get to that in detail later. Finally, the Advertising configurations can be 
  tricky. Ok, now go to the Fserv Setup window and right click and choose 'Custom 
  Advertise'. Then choose 'Make New'. Note that if you don't make a new advertisement 
  you do get a generic one with only info and no descriptions. Ok, back to advertising. 
  Now, after you chose 'Make New' a small window should've popped up. Now type 
  out your advertisement. Now the confusing part is getting the ads to run in 
  channels. Well, the best way to do this from the start is to join all the channels 
  you would ever want your script's ads to run. Then right click in one of the 
  CHANNEL windows and choose 'Channel Ad. Settings' and a window should pop up 
  with all the current channels your in listed. Now right click anywhere and choose 
  'Setting' , then Add, then choose the channel you want to add. Then a window 
  pops up asking for an advertising code. For beginner's just use code 1. So when 
  that window pops up just put in 1 and click ok. Well, that's about it. Then 
  you just join those channels that you cut on advertising and wait for users 
  to join. A few final notes, you have to join the channels you want to advertise 
  in and to put your fserv online, you have to go to the Fserv Setup window and 
  right click and choose go online. Well, that's about it. Also remember to play 
  with Panzer's options, cause some of it's best features are kind of hidden. 
  Once you master it it is one of the best Scripts out there. Also remember to 
  right clickin channel windows to get more of the advanced features. <br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="26"></a>2. Setting up Polaris</b></p>
<p> Now this Script can be a little daunting at first, but once you set up the 
  initial fserv it seems to get easier. The script, unlike Panzer, is completely 
  a Leech Script. So, you're not guaranteed anything in return. This is best for 
  dealing small files and is also popularly used to advertise FTP Servers. But 
  I'm not explaining those. First, you've gotta download the Script at <a href="http://members.tripod.com/%7EArntS/" target="_blank">http://members.xoom.com/Polaris_IRC/</a> 
  and set it up like normal. Now when you start it up, you'll realize that this 
  completely changes the look of mIRC. Though that doesn't mean it's that much 
  different. It acts the exact same way. Ok, to start your fserv, first you must 
  go to the button at the top with the name 'Polaris IRC'. Then choose 'Script 
  Settings', then 'File Server'. Now before I get into the actual configuration 
  of Polaris, let me remind you that Leech Scripts use a Queueing system which 
  I described above in the &quot;Leech Scripts&quot; section. Now you immediately 
  see that this is a lot different than Panzer. But first things first. The best 
  way to teach you how to configure Polaris is to expain each part. Ok, first 
  of all you see the two squares that say 'Max Sends' and 'Max Queues'. Ok, now 
  under 'Max Sends' their are two boxes, one for 'Each' and one for 'Total'. Now 
  'Each' is for how many sends can each user have. So if it's two, each user can 
  only download two files at once. The 'Total' means how many total sends can 
  go out before the Script begins Queueing files. So if it's 3, then once you're 
  sending out 3 files and someone makes another request, then the Script will 
  put it in Queue slot one. The 'Max Queues' options are exactly the same, except 
  when the 'Each' and 'Total' numbers have been surpassed, the user gets a message 
  saying he'll have to wait and request the file again. If you don't understand 
  what the values mean completely, you can just leave them at their defaults, 
  and your serv should work fine. Next on our learning agenda is the 'Advertising 
  Channels' square. Now this is very simple. All you do is type in the name of 
  a channel you want to advertise in and click on 'Add'. That's it. Of course 
  you must join the appropriate channels for your ads to run. Next is those three 
  small squares under 'Max Sends'. Ok, the first one, 'File Server Chat', I honestly 
  am not sure what that is for. If you can help, please <a href="mailto:Dakota@the-pain.com">email 
  me</a> and tell me. I'll give you credit. The other two I do know what they're 
  for luckily. First is 'Slot Announcer'. Now, what this does is actually one 
  of the coolest things about Polaris. You see, when you're Fserv is full, then 
  someone leaves, the Script will alert the channel of the newly free slot, if 
  that is activated that is. Now, the 'Enable on Start' is also very simple. If 
  that's on, then your Fserv will start as soon as you connect to mIRC. Simple, 
  eh? Well the next to options follow suit. First is 'Max Users' which is the 
  maximum amount of users allowed on your fserv at once. Next is 'Ad Delay Time' 
  which is how many minutes your Script will wait before posting another advertisement 
  for your fserv. The 'Note' option is just a note that will be displayed in the 
  advertisement. Ok, now after you've got all of that filled out, then click on 
  Trigger 1. Now here's one of the great aspects of Polaris, you can have seperate 
  fservs. Ok, so now click 'Enable Trigger' then go to the 'Trigger' box and type 
  your trigger. Then go down to 'Root Directory' and choose it (look above at 
  the Panzer section for more information). Then pick the 'Welcome File' which 
  is just your Rules Message (just make a new .txt file and write one and save 
  it). Now your done for the most part. If you wist to have a seperate fserv with 
  a different trigger then choose 'Trigger 2' and make a new one. But don't worry 
  about advetising them both, Polaris will do that for you. There are a few options 
  you need to know about. One is Queue Manager, which will let you remove files 
  from your Queue list (In case you have an abusive user for example). That's 
  under 'Polaris IRC', then 'Queue Manager. Just choose a file and push 'Rem'. 
  Another option that you may want to know about is the 'FTP Ad' option which 
  is found at 'Polaris IRC', then '--&gt;FTP Ad&lt;--'. This pretty straight forward 
  and if you can setup an FTP Server you can understand this. The last option 
  is the 'Request Ad'. The 'Request Ad' option can be found at 'Polaris IRC' , 
  then 'Script Settings' , then 'Request Ad'. You'd use this if you're looking 
  for a specific file. All you do is type what you're wanting in the 'Request' 
  box and add channels to advertise, and choose whether to start the Request Ad 
  on Connect and then choose the Ad Delay. Finally, when everything is set up, 
  join all the channels you want selected to advertise in and right click in the 
  channel window and choose 'Advertisements', then 'File Server' , then 'Start'. 
  Congradulations, you're using Polaris.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="27"></a>3. Setting up Sphoo </b><br>
  <br>
  Now here is a real gem. Why? Well, because it has all the features of the previous 
  two Scripts, but with one option that puts it a niche higher than all other 
  Scripts. And that is the option to switch between the type of Script it is. 
  So, if you dare, go to <a href="http://www.sphoo.f2s.com" target="_blank">http://www.sphoo.f2s.com</a> 
  and download the latest version. Ok, once you downloaded it, you'll notice you 
  do something different to load it. Whether you downloaded the .Zip or the .Exe 
  , you still extract the files into the mIRC (probably C:/mirc if your uncertain). 
  Then, you run mIRC like normal. Note that there is very little graphical change, 
  which is good if your a beginner. Now here's the odd part. To start the script, 
  type this in the Status Window: /load -rs sserv121.mrc . Now that is a little 
  weird, but once it's in there Sphoo has been loaded onto your mIRC client. Now 
  press F12 and let's get into it. Now when the window pops up, click 'Enable 
  SphooServer' and take a look around. Most of these options should be familiar 
  if you're moving up to Sphoo Script from Panzer or Polaris. The trigger option 
  is pretty straight forward, but for the beginner I'd leave the square beside 
  it unchecked for obvious reasons (Basically it's too advanced). The 'Home Directory' 
  is, of course, the root or first folder of your Server. Now the next option, 
  'Multiple Home Directories', is a great feature. This will let you set up multiple 
  fservs, with unique Home Directories, just like Polaris. Just click on add, 
  type a trigger, and fill in the other values. The next option is the most intriguing 
  reason to use Sphoo in the first place. I don't know of any other scripts that 
  have this option, and that is to switch the Script between the three basic types: 
  File Ratio, Byte Ratio, and Leech. So choose whichever and fill in the appropriate 
  options (I explained each type in detail above; see the Table of Contents). 
  Now a lot of people get confused about the next option, 'Logging'. But basically 
  all it does is keep a list of 1)What was uploaded/downloaded , 2)Who did the 
  uploading/downloading , and 3)When they did it. So it's really nothing serious/necessary 
  , but if you do want it, then fill in the necessary fields as desired. Now on 
  to the 'Other Options'. The six options at the top, with the larger white boxes 
  beside them, should be familiar to you, except Advert Interval, which is just 
  how much time is between ads (in seconds). Now the 'Add Channel to Channels 
  List On Join' will add all the channels you join while the box is checked to 
  the 'Channel List' which I'll get to later. The option beside it will join every 
  channel in the 'Channels List' when you connect to mIRC. The 'Show User has 
  just left !Trigger' option is just a slot announcer, like on Polaris (look above), 
  and the option beside it is self-explanatory. The last two options are: 'Enable 
  Function Keys' and 'Enable Fileserver READ Command', both of which are reccomended 
  to be on. Now the 'Channel List' button will allow you to edit what channels 
  you advertise in. All you have to do is type the name in the 'Channel' box and 
  push 'Add'. The 'Advertise On' option lets you decide whether to advertise in 
  all the channels your in, or to just advertise in channels on your 'Channels 
  List'. It is suggested that you not use the 'OpHelp' option as of yet, because 
  it's unnecessary for beginners to the Script. But the 'Banning' option is absolutely 
  necessary. This is the way to ban those assholes and idiots from your fserv. 
  All you do is type their handle in the 'Handle' box and push 'Add' and that's 
  it. You can also Remove them later if you wish. The 'Announcements' option lets 
  you make announcements in the channel and the 'Welcome Message' is the equivalent 
  of a 'Rules Message' for Panzer. You just type it out and push 'Ok'. The last 
  option is one of the most important. This is what you use to keep those viruses 
  and improper files out of your fserv. Just click on 'Reject File Extensions' 
  and type in the extension in the black fieild and press 'Add'(i.e. to block 
  .jpg pictures, you'd type .jpg). I'd suggest typing a message in the long blank 
  field to post to the person uploading illegal files. If you check 'Alert Me' 
  the script will tell you if someone trys to upload something you don't like. 
  The 'Duplicate File Rejection' option lets you decide how the Script should 
  handle files uploaded (or not uploaded) that have the same filename as something 
  on your serv already. And if you create a filelist then it will do, as it says, 
  make a big filelist with everything you have on the serv. Ok, now close all 
  the windows except the initial Sphoo window. Now for the last options that you 
  need to know, go to 'Commands', &lt;&gt;SphooServer&lt;&gt; (which'll be followed 
  by a version number), then notice the 'Disable SphooServer' option which will 
  take SphooServer offline. And below that there is an option of 'Unload &lt;&gt;SphooServer&lt;&gt; 
  which will completely take the Script off your mIRC client. Now if you set up 
  your fserv right, join all the channels you've set for advertising and enjoy 
  yourself. If you have any problems just push F12 and see if something's wrong. 
  Just try to play with the settings 'til it works, and there is always the website 
  <a href="http://www.Sphoo.f2s.com" target="_blank">http://www.Sphoo.f2s.com</a> 
  which I believe the Script writer takes questions. Well, happy SphooServing!</p>
<p> <b><a name="28"></a>C.Writing a Rules Message</b></p>
<p> The Rules Message is one of the most important parts of a fserv. It's the 
  way that a fserv host basically lays down the rules and it is the only time 
  that a host will be able to communicate with a user and warn them of what will 
  happen if they break the rules. But what's the proper way to write a Rules Message? 
  Well, it's actually simpler than it may seem. First off, you should have some 
  key elements - 1) Say what you offer 2) Say what you want uploaded 3) Tell what 
  they'll get banned for 4) Tell them whether or not they can message you 5) Have 
  your Rules Message clearly readable. Don't use stupid slang or ignorant spacing. 
  Don't waste time and get to the point. And whatever you do, don't use ASCII 
  art in your Rules Message, it always looks like crap. So there you go, just 
  lay down the rules and boundries and ban them if they don't follow. Note: Some 
  Scripts refer to the Rules Message as the Welcome Message , but it's the same 
  thing.</p>
<p> <b><a name="29"></a>D. Writing an Advertisement</b></p>
<p> One of the most lucrative and oldest businesses in the world is advertising. 
  And now it's your turn. Surprisingly the basic idea of advertising on mIRC is 
  completely different than in the real world. How you ask? Well, for one, the 
  channels you advertise most definately has a theme, so your not just blurting 
  out an ad and hoping someone with that interest sees it, instead your guaranteed 
  someone in the place will like it. So how do you go about writing it? Simple. 
  You keep it short and to the point. Don't tell people what they'll get banned 
  for or any of that, just tell what you offer and what you want. And list anything 
  that will earn leech. That's it. That's a good and effective ad. For example, 
  if your in a mp3 channel, and your serv deals mainly in rap mp3s, then your 
  ad may say something like: !RapMusic offering: Great rap tunes by album and 
  artist, organized well. Wanting: Any good Gansta rap and will give leech for 
  rare Tupac mp3s. That's it. Very simple. It's short, to the point, and still 
  interesting. And it tells people what to expect so they don't join, unless interested. 
  By the way, the !RapMusic offering: part is something common if using Panzer 
  Script, so don't put that in your ads. Well, that's about it. </p>
