<hr>
<P>Welcome to another Hacking Truths Manual. This time I have a collection of
Tips and Tricks which no body normally knows, the secrets which Microsoft is
afraid to tell the people, the information which you will seldom find all
gathered up and arranged in a single file. To fully reap this Manual you need to
have a basic understanding of the Windows Registry, as almost all the Tricks and
Tips involve this file. </P>
<P>****************</P>
<P>Important Note: Before you read on, you need to keep one thing in mind.
Whenever you make changes to the Windows Registry you need to Refresh it before
the changes take place. Simply press F5 to refresh the registry and enable the
changes. If this does not work Restart your system</P>
<P>****************</P><B>
<P>Exiting Windows the Cool and Quick Way</P></B>
<P>Normally it takes a hell lot of time just Shutting down Windows, you have to
move your mouse to the Start Button, click on it, move it again over Shut Down,
click, then move it over the necessary option and click, then move the cursor
over the OK button and once again (you guessed it) click.This whole process can
be shortened by creating shortcuts on the Desktop which will shut down Windows
at the click of a button. Start by creating a new shortcut( right click and
select New&gt; Shortcut). Then in the command line box, type (without the
quotes.)</P>
<P>'C:\windows\rundll.exe user.exe,exitwindowsexec'</P>
<P>This Shortcut on clicking will restart Windows immediately without any
Warning. To create a Shortcut to Restarting Windows, type the following in the
Command Line box:</P>
<P>'c:\windows\rundll.exe user.exe,exitwindows'</P>
<P>This Shortcut on clicking will shut down Windows immediately without any
Warning. </P><B>
<P>Ban Shutdowns : A trick to Play on Lamers</P></B>
<P>This is a neat trick you can play on that lamer that has a huge ego, in this
section I teach you, how to disable the Shut Down option in the Shut Down Dialog
Box. This trick involves editing the registry, so please make backups. Launch
regedit.exe and go to :</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</P>
<P>In the right pane look for the NoClose Key. If it is not already there then
create it by right clicking in the right pane and selecting New &gt; String
Value.(Name it NoCloseKey ) Now once you see the NoCloseKey in the right pane,
right click on it and select Modify. Then Type 1 in the Value Data Box.</P>
<P>Doing the above on a Win98 system disables the Shut Down option in the Shut
Down Dialog Box. But on a Win95 machine if the value of NoCloseKey is set to 1
then click on the Start &gt; Shut Down button displays the following error
message:</P><B>
<P>This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this
computer. Please contact your system administrator</B>.</P>
<P>You can enable the shut down option by changing the value of NoCloseKey to 0
or simply deleting the particular entry i.e. deleting NoCloseKey.</P>
<P>Instead of performing the above difficult to remember process, simply save
the following with an extension of .reg and add it's contents to the registry by
double clicking on it.</P><B>
<P>REGEDIT4</P>
<P>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer]</P>
<P>"NoClose"="1"</P>
<P>Disabling Display of Drives in My Computer</P></B>
<P>This is yet another trick you can play on your geek friend. To disable the
display of local or networked drives when you click My Computer go to :</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</P>
<P>Now in the right pane create a new DWORD item and name it NoDrives. Now
modify it's value and set it to 3FFFFFF (Hexadecimal) Now press F5 to refresh.
When you click on My Computer, no drives will be shown. To enable display of
drives in My Computer, simply delete this DWORD item. It's .reg file is as
follows:</P><B>
<P>REGEDIT4</P>
<P>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer]</P>
<P>"NoDrives"=dword:03ffffff</P>
<P>Take Over the Screen Saver</P></B>
<P>To activate and deactivate the screen saver whenever you want, goto the
following registry key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ScreenSavers</P>
<P>Now add a new string value and name it Mouse Corners. Edit this new value to
-Y-N. Press F5 to refresh the registry. Voila! Now you can activate your
screensaver by simply placing the mouse cursor at the top right corner of the
screen and if you take the mouse to the bottom left corner of the screen, the
screensaver will deactivate. </P><B>
<P>Pop a banner each time Windows Boots</P></B>
<P>To pop a banner which can contain any message you want to display just before
a user is going to log on, go to the key:</P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WinLogon</P>
<P>Now create a new string Value in the right pane named LegalNoticeCaption and
enter the value that you want to see in the Menu Bar. Now create yet another new
string value and name it: LegalNoticeText. Modify it and insert the message you
want to display each time Windows boots. This can be effectively used to display
the company's private policy each time the user logs on to his NT box. It's .reg
file would be:</P><B>
<P>REGEDIT4</P>
<P>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon]</P>
<P>"LegalNoticeCaption"="Caption here."</P>
<P>Delete the Tips of the Day to save 5KB</P></B>
<P>Windows 95 had these tips of the day which appeared on a system running a
newly installed Windows OS. These tips of the day are stored in the Windows
Registry and consume 5K of space. For those of you who are really concerned
about how much free space your hard disk has, I have the perfect trick.</P>
<P>To save 5K go to the following key in Regedit:</P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Tips</P>
<P>Now simply delete these tricks by selecting and pressing the DEL key.</P><B>
<P>Change the Default Locations</P></B>
<P>To change the default drive or path where Windows will look for it's
installation files, go to the key:</P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\SourcePath</P>
<P>Now you can edit as you wish.</P><B>
<P>Secure your Desktop Icons and Settings</P></B>
<P>You can save your desktop settings and secure it from your nerdy friend by
playing with the registry. Simply launch the Registry Editor go to:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</P>
<P>In the right pane create a new DWORD Value named NoSaveSettings and modify
it's value to 1. Refresh and restart for the settings to get saved.</P><B>
<P>CLSID Folders Explained</P></B>
<P>Don't you just hate those stubborn stupid icons that refuse to leave the
desktop, like the Network Neighborhood icon. I am sure you want to know how you
can delete them. You may say, that is really simple, simply right click on the
concerned icon and select Delete. Well not exactly, you see when you right click
on these special folders( see entire list below)neither the rename nor the
delete option does not appear. To delete these folders, there are two methods,
the first one is using the System Policy Editor(Poledit in the Windows
installation CD)and the second is using the Registry.</P>
<P>Before we go on, you need to understand what CLSID values are. These folders,
like the Control Panel, Inbox, The Microsoft Network, Dial Up Networking etc are
system folders. Each system folder has a unique CLSID key or the Class ID which
is a 16-byte value which identifies an individual object that points to a
corresponding key in the registry.</P>
<P>To delete these system Folders from the desktop simply go to the following
registry key:</P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\Namespace{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}</P>
<P>To delete an icon simply delete the 16 byte CLSID value within "NameSpace".
The following are the CLSID values of the most commonly used icons:</P><B>
<P>My Briefcase:{85BBD920-42AO-1069-A2E4-08002B30309D}</P>
<P>Desktop: {00021400-0000-0000-C000-0000000000046}</P>
<P>Control Panel:{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}</P>
<P>Dial-Up-Networking:{992CFFA0-F557-101A-88EC-00DD01CCC48}</P>
<P>Fonts: {BD84B380-8CA2-1069-AB1D-08000948534}</P>
<P>Inbox :{00020D76-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</P>
<P>My Computer :{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}</P>
<P>Network Neighborhood:{208D2C60-3AEA-1069-A2D7-O8002B30309D}</P>
<P>Printers :{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-O8002B30309D}</P>
<P>Recycle Bin :{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}</P>
<P>The Microsoft Network:{00028B00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</P>
<P>History: {FF393560-C2A7-11CF-BFF4-444553540000}</P>
<P>Winzip :{E0D79300-84BE-11CE-9641-444553540000}</P></B>
<P>For example, to delete the Recycle Bin, first note down it's CLSID value,
which is: 645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E. Now go to the Namespace key in
the registry and delete the corresponding key.</P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}</P>
<P>Similarly to delete the History folder, delete the following key:</P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\{FBF23B42-E3F0-101B-8488-00AA003E56F8}</P>
<P>Sometimes, you may need to play a trick on your brother or friend, well this
one teaches you how to hide all icons from the Desktop. Go to the following
registry key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</P>
<P>In the right pane create a new DWORD value by the name: NoDesktop and set its
value to: 1. Reboot and you will find no icons on the desktop.</P>
<P>Till now you simply learnt how to delete the special system folders by
deleting a registry key, but the hack would have been better if there was a way
of adding the DELETE and RENAME option to the right click context menus of these
special folders. You can actually change the right click context menu of any
system folder and add any of the following options: RENAME, DELETE, CUT, COPY,
PASTE and lots more.</P>
<P>This hack too requires you to know the CLSID value of the system folder whose
menu you want to customize. In this section, I have taken up Recycle Bin as the
folder whose context menu I am going to edit.</P>
<P>Firstly launch the registry editor and open the following registry key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\ShellFolder.</P>
<P>In Case you want to edit some other folder like say the FONTS folder, then
you will open the following key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{CLSID VALUE HERE}\ShellFolder.</P>
<P>In the right pane there will be a DWORD value names attributes. Now consider
the following options:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>To add the Rename option to the menu, change the value of Attributes to
  <P>50 01 00 20 </P>
  <LI>To add the Delete option to the menu, change the value of Attributes to
  </LI></OL>
<P>60 01 00 20 </P>
<P>3. To add both the Rename &amp; Delete options to the menu, change the value
of Attributes to 70,01,00,20 </P>
<P>4. Add Copy to the menu, change Attributes to 41 01 00 20 </P>
<P>5. Add Cut to the menu, change Attributes to 42 01 00 20 </P>
<P>6. Add Copy &amp; Cut to the menu, change Attributes to 43 01 00 20 </P>
<P>7. Add Paste to the menu, change Attributes to 44 01 00 20 </P>
<P>8. Add Copy &amp; Paste to the menu, change Attributes to 45 01 00 20 </P>
<P>9. Add Cut &amp; Paste to the menu, change Attributes to 46 01 00 20 </P>
<P>10.Add all Cut, Copy &amp; Paste to the menu, change Attributes to 47 01 00
20 </P>
<P>We want to add only the Rename option to the right click context menu of the
Recycle Bin, so change the value of attributes to: 50 01 00 20. Press F5 to
refresh and then after rebooting you will find that when you right click on the
Recycle Bin a RENAME option pops up too.</P>
<P>To reset the default Windows options change the value of Attributes back to
</P>
<P>40 01 00 20 </P>
<P>The Registry File which one can create for the above process would be
something like the below:</P>
<P>REGEDIT4</P>
<P>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\Shell-Folder]</P>
<P>"Attributes"=hex:50,01,00,20</P>
<P>To access say the Modem Properties in the Control Panel Folder, the normal
procedure is: Click on Start, Click on Settings&gt; Control Panel and then wait
for the Control Panel window to pop up and then ultimately click on the Modems
icon.</P>
<P>Wouldn't it be lovely if you could shorten the process to: Click on Start&gt;
Control Panel&gt;Modems. Yes you can add the Control Panel and also all other
Special System Folders directly to the first level Start Menu. Firstly collect
the CLSID value of the folder you want to add to the start menu. I want to add
Control Panel hence the CLSID value is: 21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D</P>
<P>Now right click on the Start Button and select Open. Now create a new folder
and name it: Control Panel.{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}</P>
<P>NOTE: Do not forget the period after the 'l' in Panel. Similarly all system
folders can be added to the Start Menu.(accept My Briefcase, I think)</P><B>
<P>Deleting System Options from the Start menu</P></B>
<P>You can actually remove the Find and Run options from the start menu by
performing a simple registry hack. Again like always Launch the registry editor
and scroll down to the below key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</P>
<P>Right-click on the right pane and select New, DWORD Value. Name it NoFind.(To
remove the RUN option name it NoRun). Double-click the newly create DWORD to
edit it's value and enter 1 as its value. This will disable the FIND option of
the Start Menu and will also disable the default Shortcut key(F3 for Find.)</P>
<P>To restore the Run or find command modify the value of the DWORD to 0 or
simply Delete the DWORD value.</P><B>
<P>Fed Up of the boring Old Yellow Folder Icons?[Drive Icons Included]</P></B>
<P>NOTE: This trick hasn't been tried on Win98.</P>
<P>You can easily change the boring yellow folder icons to your own personalized
icons. Simply create a text file and copy the following lines into it:</P>
<P>[.ShellClassInfo]</P>
<P>ICONFILE=Drive:\Path\Icon_name.extension</P>
<P>Save this text file by the name, desktop.ini in the folder, whose icon you
want to change. Now to prevent this file from getting deleted change it's
attributes to Hidden and Read Only by using the ATTRIB command.</P>
<P>To change the icon of a drive, create a text file containing the following
lines:</P>
<P>[Autorun]</P>
<P>ICON=Drive:\Path\Icon_name.extension</P>
<P>Save this file in the root of the drive whose icon you want to change and
name it autorun.inf For Example, if you want to change the icon of a floppy,
SAVE THE icon in a:\icon_name.ico One can also create a kewl icon for the Hard
Disk and create a text file [autorun.inf] and store it in "c:\".</P><B>
<P>&nbsp;Securing NT</P></B>
<P>By default, NT 4.0 displays the last person who logged onto the system. This
can be considered to be a security threat, especially in the case of those who
choose their password to be same as their Username. To disable this bug which
actually is a feature, go to the following key in the registry editor:</P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</P>
<P>Click and select the ReportBookOK item and create a new string value called
DontDisplayLastUserName. Modify it and set it's value to 1.</P>
<P>As a system administrator, you can ensure that the passwords chosen by the
users are not too lame or too easy to guess. NT has this lovely utility called
the User Manager which allows the administrator to set the age limit of the
password which forces the users to change the password after a certain number of
days. You can also set the minimum length of passwords and prevent users to use
passwords which already have been used earlier and also enable account lockouts
which will deactivate an account after a specified number of failed login
attempts.</P>
<P>When you log on to Win NT, you should disable Password Caching, this ensures
Single NT Domain login and also prevents secondary Windows Logon screen.</P>
<P>Simply copy the following lines to a plain text ASCII editor like: Notepad
and save it with an extension, .reg </P>
<P>----------------DISABLE.reg-----------------</P>
<P>REGEDIT4</P>
<P>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Network]</P>
<P>"DisablePwdCaching"=dword:00000001</P>
<P>----------------DISABLE.reg-----------------</P>
<P>To Enable Password Caching use the following .reg file:</P>
<P>--------------Enable.reg-----------------</P>
<P>REGEDIT4</P>
<P>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Network]</P>
<P>"DisablePwdCaching"=dword:00000000</P>
<P>--------------Enable.reg-----------------</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Cleaning Recent Docs Menu and the RUN MRU</P></B>
<P>The Recent Docs menu can be easily disabled by editing the Registry. To do
this go to the following Key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
</P>
<P>Now in the right pane, create a new DWORD value by the name: NoRecentDocsMenu
and set it's value to 1. Restart Explorer to save the changes.</P>
<P>You can also clear the RUN MRU history. All the listings are stored in the
key:</P>
<P>HKEY_USERS\.Default\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU</P>
<P>You can delete individual listings or the entire listing. To delete History
of Find listings go to:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Doc Find
Spec MRU</P>
<P>and delete.</P><B>
<P>Customizing the Right Click Context Menu of the Start Menu</P></B>
<P>When you right click on the start menu, only 3 options pop up: Open, Explore,
and Find. You can add your own programs to this pop up menu( which comes up when
we right click on it.) Open Regedit and go to the following registry key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Shell </P>
<P>Right click on the shell and create a new Sub Key (You can create a new
SubKey by right clicking on the Shell Key and selecting New &gt; Key.). Type in
the name of the application you want to add to the start menu. I want to add
Notepad to the Start Menu and hence I name this new sub key, Notepad. Now right
click on the new registry key that you just created and create yet another new
key named Command. Enter the full path of the application, in this case Notepad
in the default value of Command in the right </P>
<P>pane. So I Modify the value of the default string value and enter the full
pathname of Notepad: </P>
<P>c:\wndows\notepad.exe.</P>
<P>Now press F5 to refresh. Now if you right click on the Start Button you will
find a new addition to the Pop Up Menu called Notepad. Clicking on it will
launch Notepad.</P>
<P>We can not only add but also remove the existing options in this pop up
box.</P>
<P>To delete the Find option, go to the following registry key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Shell\Find </P>
<P>Delete Find. DO NOT delete Open else you will not be able to open any folders
in the Start Menu like Programs, Accessories etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>BMP Thumbnail As Icon</P></B>
<P>You can actually change the default BMP icon to a thumbnail version of the
actual BMP file. To do this simply go to HKCU\Paint.Picture\Default. In the
right pane change the value of default to %1. Please note however that this will
slow down the display rate in explorer if there are too many BMP thumbnails to
display. You can use other icons too, simply enter the pathname.To restore back
to the normal change the vale of default back to:
C:\Progra~1\Access~1\MSPAINT.EXE,1. </P><B>
<P>Customizing The Shortcut Arrow</P></B>
<P>All shortcuts have a tiny black arrow attached to it's icon to distinguish
from normal files. This arrow can sometimes be pretty annoying and as a Hacker
should know how to change each and everything, here goes another trick. Launch
the Registry Editor and go to: </P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\Shell
Icons. </P>
<P>Now, on the right pane is a list of icons ( we found out that on some
systems, Windows 98 especially, the right pane is blank. Don't worry, just add
the value as required ). Find the value 29. If it isn't there, just add it. The
value of this string should be C:\Windows\system\shell32.dll, 29 ( which means
the 30th icon in shell32.dll - the first one begins with 0 ). Now, we need blank
icon to do this. Just create one with white as the whole icon. Go here to learn
how to create an icon. Once done just change the value to C:\xxx.ico, 0 where
"xxx" is the full path of the icon file and "0" is the icon in it.</P>
<P>Now for some fun. If the blank icon is a bit boring, change it again. You
will find that under shell32.dll there is a gear icon, a shared folder ( the
hand ) and much more. Experiment for yourself!</P>
<P>Use Perl to Get List or Services Running on your NT box</P>
<P>Use the following Perl Script to get a list of Services running on your NT
system</P>

enjoyable but sometimes we need the Toolbar but also need to have extra viewing
area. Now this hack teaches you how to change the size of the Internet Explorer
toolbar. This registry hack is a bit complicated as it involves Binary values,
so to make it simple, I have included the following registry file which will
enable the resizable option of the Internet Explorer toolbar which was present
in the beta version of IE.</P>
<P>REGEDIT4</P>
<P>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Toolbar]</P>
<P>"Theater"=hex:0c,00,00,00,4c,00,00,00,74,00,00,00,18,00,00,00,1b,00,00,00,5c,\</P>

<P>*******************</P>
<P>HACKING TRUTH: Internet Explorer 5 displays the friendly version of HTTP
errors like NOT FOUND etc . They are aimed at making things easier for newbies.
If you would rather prefer to see the proper error pages for the web server
you're using, go to Tools, Internet Options and select the Advanced tab. Then
scroll down and uncheck the Show friendly http errors box.</P>
<P>*******************</P><B>
<P>Making the Internet Explorer &amp; the Explorer Toolbars Fancy</P></B>
<P>The Internet Explorer toolbar looks pretty simple. Want to make it fancy and
kewl? Why not add a background image to it. To do this kewl hack launch the
Windows Registry Editor and go to the following key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ Internet Explorer\Toolbar\. </P>
<P>Now in the right pane create a new String Value and name it BackBitmap and
modify it's value to the path of the Bitmap you want to dress it up with by
rightclicking on it and choosing Modify.&nbsp;When you reboot the Internet
Explorer and the Windows Explorer toolbars will have a new look.</P><B>
<P>Change Internet Explorer's Caption</P></B>
<P>Don't like the caption of Internet Explorer caption? Want to change it? Open
the registry editor and go to </P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main. </P>
<P>In the right pane create a new String Value names Window Title (Note the
space between Window and Title). Right click on this newly created String Value
and select Modify. Type in the new caption you want to be displayed. Restart for
the settings to take place.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now let's move on to some <B>Outlook Express</B> Tricks.&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>Colorful Background</P></B>
<P>Don't like the boring background colors of Outlook Express? To change it
launch the Windows Registry Editor and scroll down to the </P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Mail And News key. </P>
<P>On the left pane, click on ColorCycle or select Edit and Modify in the menu.
Now change the value to 1. Close and restart. Now, launch Outlook Express and
whenever you open up a New Message, hold down ctrl-shift and tap the z key to
scroll to change the background color. Repeat the keystroke to cycle through the
colors.</P><B>
<P>Internet Explorer 5 Hidden Features</P></B>
<P><BR>Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 has several hidden features which can be
controlled using the Windows Registry. Open your registry and scroll down to the
following key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet
Explorer\Restrictions</P>
<P>Create a new DWORD value named x(See complete list of values of x below) and
modify it's value to 1 to enable it and to 0 to disable it.</P>
<P>NoBrowserClose : Disable the option of closing Internet Explorer. </P>
<P>NoBrowserContextMenu : Disable right-click context menu. </P>
<P>NoBrowserOptions : Disable the Tools / Internet Options menu. </P>
<P>NoBrowserSaveAs : Disable the ability to Save As. </P>
<P>NoFavorites : Disable the Favorites. </P>
<P>NoFileNew : Disable the File / New command. </P>
<P>NoFileOpen : Disable the File / Open command. </P>
<P>NoFindFiles : Disable the Find Files command. </P>
<P>NoSelectDownloadDir : Disable the option of selecting a download directory.
</P>
<P>NoTheaterMode : Disable the Full Screen view option. </P><B>
<P>Hacking Secrets</P></B>
<P>Almost all system administrators make certain changes and make the system
restricted. System Administrators can hide the RUN option, the FIND command, the
entire Control Panel, drives in My Computer like D: A: etc. They can even
restrict activities of a hacker my disabling or hiding, even the tiniest options
or tools. </P>
<P>Most commonly these restrictions are imposed locally and are controlled by
the Windows Registry. But sometimes the smart system administrators control the
activities of the hacker by imposing restrictions remotely through the main
server.</P>
<P>Poledit or Policy Editor is a small kewl tool which is being commonly used by
system administrators to alter the settings of a system. This utility is not
installed by default by Windows. You need to install in manually from the
Windows 98 Installation Kit from the Resource Kit folder. user.dat file that we
saw earlier. </P>
<P>The Policy Editor tool imposes restrictions on the user's system by editing
the user.dat file which in turn means that it edits the Windows Registry to
change the settings. It can be used to control or restrict access to each and
every folder and option you could ever think of. It has the power to even
restrict access to individual folders, files, the Control Panel, MS DOS, the
drives available etc. Sometimes this software does make life really hard for a
Hacker. So how can we remove the restrictions imposed by the Policy Editor? Well
read ahead to learn more.</P>
<P>You see the Policy Editor is not the only way to restrict a user's
activities. As we already know that the Policy Editor edits the Windows
Registry(user.dat) file to impose such restrictions. So this in turn would mean
that we can directly make changes to the Windows Registry using a .reg file or
directly to remove or add restrictions.</P>
<P>Launch Regedit and go to the following Registry Key:</P>
<P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/CurrentVersion/Policies</P>
<P>Under this key, there will definitely be a key named explorer. Now under this
explorer key we can create new DWORD values and modify it's value to 1 in order
to impose the restriction. If you want to remove the Restriction, then you can
simply delete the respective DWORD values or instead change their values to 0.
The following is a list of DWORD values that can be created under the Explorer
Key-:</P>
<P>NoDeletePrinter: Disables Deletion of already installed Printers</P>
<P>NoAddPrinter: Disables Addition of new Printers</P>
<P>NoRun : Disables or hides the Run Command</P>
<P>NoSetFolders: Removes Folders from the Settings option on Start Menu (Control
Panel, Printers, Taskbar)</P>
<P>NoSetTaskbar: Removes Taskbar system folder from the Settings option on Start
Menu</P>
<P>NoFind: Removes the Find Tool (Start &gt;Find)</P>
<P>NoDrives: Hides and does not display any Drives in My Computer</P>
<P>NoNetHood: Hides or removes the Network Neighborhood icon from the
desktop</P>
<P>NoDesktop: Hides all items including, file, folders and system folders from
the Desktop</P>
<P>NoClose: Disables Shutdown and prevents the user from normally shutting down
Windows.</P>
<P>NoSaveSettings: Means to say, 'Don't save settings on exit'</P>
<P>DisableRegistryTools: Disable Registry Editing Tools (If you disable this
option, the Windows Registry Editor(regedit.exe) too </P>
<P>will not work.)</P>
<P>NoRecentDocsHistory: Removes Recent Document system folder from the Start
Menu (IE 4 and above)</P>
<P>ClearRecentDocsOnExit: Clears the Recent Documents system folder on Exit.</P>
<P>Nolnternetlcon: Removes the Internet (system folder) icon from the
Desktop</P>
<P>Under the same key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/CurrentVersion/Policies you can create new
subkeys other than the already existing Explorer key. Now create a new key and
name it System. Under this new key, system we can create the following new DWORD
values(1 for enabling the particular option and 0 for disabling the particular
option):</P>
<P>NODispCPL: Hides Control Panel</P>
<P>NoDispBackgroundPage: Hides Background page.</P>
<P>NoDispScrsavPage: Hides Screen Saver Page</P>
<P>NoDispAppearancePage: Hides Appearance Page</P>
<P>NoDispSettingsPage: Hides Settings Page</P>
<P>NoSecCPL: Disables Password Control Panel</P>
<P>NoPwdPage: Hides Password Change Page</P>
<P>NoAdminPaqe: Hides Remote Administration Page</P>
<P>NoProfilePage: Hides User Profiles Page</P>
<P>NoDevMgrPage: Hides Device Manager Page</P>
<P>NoConfigPage: Hides Hardware Profiles Page</P>
<P>NoFileSysPage: Hides File System Button</P>
<P>NoVirtMemPage: Hides Virtual Memory Button</P>
<P>Similarly, if we create a new subkey named Network, we can add the following
DWORD values under it(1 for enabling the particular option and 0 for disabling
the particular option):</P>
<P>NoNetSetupSecurityPage: Hides Network Security Page</P>
<P>NoNelSetup: Hides or disables the Network option in the Control Panel</P>
<P>NoNetSetupIDPage: Hides the Identification Page</P>
<P>NoNetSetupSecurityPage: Hides the Access Control Page</P>
<P>NoFileSharingControl: Disables File Sharing Controls</P>
<P>NoPrintSharing: Disables Print Sharing Controls</P>
<P>Similarly, if we create a new subkey named WinOldApp, we can add the
following DWORD values under it(1 for enabling the particular option and 0 for
disabling the particular option):</P>
<P>Disabled: Disable MS-DOS Prompt</P>
<P>NoRealMode: Disable Single-Mode MS-DOS.</P>
<P>So you see if you have access to the Windows Registry, then you can easily
create new DWORD values and set heir value to 1 for enabling the particular
option and 0 for disabling the particular option. But Sometimes, access to the
Windows Registry is blocked. So what do you do? Go to the Windows Directory and
delete either user.dat or system.dat (These 2 files constitute the Windows
Registry.) and reboot. As soon as Windows logs in, it will display a Warning
Message informing you about an error in the Windows Registry. Simply ignore this
Warning Message and Press CTRL+DEL+ALT to get out of this warning message.(Do
not press OK) You will find that all restrictions have been removed.</P>
<P>The most kind of restriction found quite commonly is the Specific Folder
Restriction, in which users are not allowed access to specific folders, the most
common being the Windows folder, or sometimes even access to My Computer is
blocked. In effect, you simply cannot seem to access the important kewl files
which are needed by you to do remove restrictions. What do you? Well use the RUN
command. (START &gt;RUN). But unfortunately a system administrator who is
intelligent enough to block access to specific folder, would definitely have
blocked access to the RUN command. Again we are stuck.</P>
<P>Windows is supposed to be the most User Friendly Operating System on earth.
(At least Microsoft Says so.)</P>
<P>It gives the User an option to do the same thing in various ways. You see the
RUN command is only the most convenient option of launching applications, but
not the only way. In Windows you can create shortcuts to almost anything from a
file, folder to a Web URL. So say your system administrator has blocked access
to the c:\windows\system folder and you need to access it. What do you do?
Simply create a Shortcut to it. To do this right click anywhere on the desktop
and select New &gt; Shortcut. A new window titled Create Shortcut pops up. Type
in the path of the restricted folder you wish to access, in this case
c:\windows\system. Click Next, Enter the friendly name of the Shortcut and then
click Finish. Now you can access the restricted folder by simply double clicking
on the shortcut icon. Well that shows how protected and secure *ahem Windows
*ahem is.</P>
<P>****************</P>
<P>HACKING TRUTH: Sometimes when you try to delete a file or a folder, Windows
displays an error message saying that the file is protected. This simply means
that the file is write protected, or in other words the R option is +. Get it?
Anyway, you can stop Windows from displaying this error message and straightaway
delete this file by changing its attributes to Non Read Only. This can be done
by Right Clicking on the file, selecting Properties and then </P>
<P>unselecting the Read Only Option.</P>
<P>***************</P>
<P>There is yet another way of accessing restricted folders. Use see, DOS has a
lovely command known as START. Its general syntax is:</P>
<P>START application_path</P>
<P>It does do what it seems to do, start applications. So in you have access to
DOS then you can type in the START command to get access to the restricted
folder. Now mostly access to DOS too would be blocked. So again you can use the
shortcut trick to launch, c:\command.com or c:\windows\command.com. (Command.com
is the file which launches MS DOS).</P>
<P>Accessing Restricted Drives.</P>
<P>The problem with most system administrators is that they think that the users
or Hackers too are stupid. Almost all system administrators use the Registry
Trick (Explained Earlier) to hide all drives in My Computer. So in order to
unhide or display all drives, simply delete that particular key.(Refer to
beginning of Untold Secrets Section.)</P>
<P>Some systems have the floppy disk disabled through the BIOS. On those systems
if the BIOS is protected, you may need to crack the BIOS password. (For that
Refer to the Windows Hacking Chapter). Sometimes making drives readable
(Removing R +) and then creating Shortcuts to them also helps us to get access
to them.</P>
<P>Further Changing your Operating System's Looks by editing .htt files</P>
<P>If you have installed Windows Desktop Update and have the view as Web Page
option enabled, you can customise the way the folder looks by selecting View
&gt; Customise this folder. Here you can change the background and other things
about that particular folder. Well that is pretty lame, right? We hackers
already know things as lame as that. Read on for some kewl stuff.</P>
<P>Well, you could also change the default that is stored in a Hidden HTML
Template file (I think so..) which is nothing but a HTML document with a .htt
extension. This .htt file is found at: %systemroot%\web\folder.htt.</P>
<P>The %systemroot% stands for the drive in which Windows is Installed, which is
normally C:</P>
<P>You can edit these .htt files almost just like you edit normal .HTM or .HTML
files. Simply open them in an ASCII editor like Notepad. The following is a list
of .htt files on your system which control various folders and which can be
edited to customise the way various folders look.</P>
<P>controlp.htt Control Panel</P>
<P>printers.htt Printers</P>
<P>mycomp.htt My Computer</P>
<P>safemode.htt Safe Mode</P>
<P>All these files are found in the web folder in %systemfolder%. The folder.htt
file has a line:</P>
<P>'Here's a good place to add a few lines of your own"</P>
<P>which is the place where you can add your own A HREF links. These links would
then appear in the folder whose folder.htt file you edited. All this might sound
really easy and simple, but you see these .htt files do not contain normal HTML
code, instead they contain a mixture of HTML and web bots. Hence they can be
difficult for newbies to understand.</P>
<P>Well that's it for now, more tricks later, till then goodbye.</P>
