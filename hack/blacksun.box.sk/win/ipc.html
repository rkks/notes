  This will explain the &quot;uses&quot; of IPC for hackers. Inter-Process Communication 
  is used for data sharing between applications and computers. We will be looking 
  at Windows NT default IPC$ share use for communication between computers. This 
  share is what we use to start to gain access to the server. What we will look 
  at before we start is the NET commands for the console in NT. (Note I was unable 
  to create a null connection using a 95/98 computer I had to use an NT computer) 
  The net commands that we will be using are net use and net view. Now get in 
  to the console (fake ms-dos) in windows. Pick out your target and make sure 
  that it is an NT system and it has port 139 open. You need port 139 open so 
  that net-bios is on. After checking for that you go to the console and type: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><br>
    <br>
    Example 1&gt; C:\&gt;NET USE \\TARGET\IPC$ * /USER:<br>
    Example 2&gt; C:\&gt;NET USE \\TARGET\IPC$ * /USER:&quot;&quot;<br>
    Example 3&gt; C:\&gt;NET USE \\TARGET\IPC$ &quot;&quot; /USER:&quot;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Note: For some reason the command varies a little bit from NT to NT</li>
  <li>Note: TARGET is the name or IP of the computer, ex. \\211.3.4.11\ipc$ * 
    /user:</li>
  <li>Note: If it works youll get&gt; The command completed successfully.</li>
  <li>Note: To check the connection type NET USE \\TARGET\IPC$ </li>
</ul>
<p>After starting a null connection you could try to access the hidden shares. 
  The default hidden shares are: C$, PRINT$, ADMIN$, IPC$. As you can probably 
  tell shares are hidden by putting a $ at the end of the share name. Sometime 
  shares don't have passwords so you can use them. When you create a null connection 
  you have the least possible rights. Next you could try using net view. To do 
  this open the console and type:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>C:\&gt;net view \\TARGET (Shares)<br>
  Or<br>
  C:\&gt;net view /workgroup:TARGETWG (Computers in workgroup)<br>
  Or<br>
  C:\&gt;net view /domain:TARGETD (Computers in domain)</p>
<p>(Note: change TARGETWG to the name of the workgroup to see all of the computers 
  connected)<br>
  (Note: change TARGET to the IP or name of the computer to see all none hidden 
  shares)<br>
  (Note: change TARGETD to domain name example: /domain: Bob.com )<br>
  If you can't find an open share you could use a program that I like a lot called 
  winfo. Winfo will get all of the user names from the target. Or another programs 
  that is Nat(NetBIOS Auditing Tool). Nat will try names and passwords (dictionary 
  attack) to get the right one. Another well like program is sid2user and user2sid. 
  <br>
  Last but not least there are DoS attacks that could be preformed. Dos attacks 
  become outdated quickly but new ones are always poping up. A good Dos attack 
  that works on NT systems with printer capibiltes. It kinda goes like this (null 
  connection is needed): \\target\pipe\spoolss. Do this alot. The next one is 
  one that im not sure that works but you fill all the connections possible on: 
  \\target\pipe\samr. For that I would recomend use a program like ubend.exe.<br>
