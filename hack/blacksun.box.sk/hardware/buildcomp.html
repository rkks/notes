<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b><br>
  <br>
  In this tutorial I will try an teach you how to successfully build your own 
  computer! There are many benefits to building your own computer.</p>
<ol>
  <li>You get hand's on experience learning how a computer works</li>
  <li>Its a hell of alot less expensive then buying one from a retailer</li>
  <li>Its a hell of alot more reliable than buying one from a retailer being that 
    you hand select QUALITY parts and put it togethor yourself.</li>
  <li>You can do your own tech support no more relying on stupid Best Buy Tech's 
    that don't know the difference between their ass and a hard disk jumper (don't 
    worry I'll tell you what those are later)</li>
</ol>
<p><b><font size="4">Section #1 (What Your Going To Need)</font></b><br>
</p>
<p>Here we will discuss a list of the parts you need and the best place to purchase 
  them. If you want the best<br>
  prices on computer hardware you will definitly want to look online. Unfortunatly 
  (and for some of you very fortunatly<br>
  if you know what I mean) this requires the use of a credit card. Below is a 
  general list of the devices you will <br>
  need...</p>
<ol>
  <li> A Computer Case (Something To Put All The Computer Parts Togethor In)<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Should only run you about 50 dollars</li>
      <li>Beware the cheap ones with cheap power supplies they will die in a year</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> A Mother Board (Everything Will Be Plugged Into The Mother Board)</li>
  <li> A Floppy Drive and a CDROM (Should Be Obvious)</li>
  <li> A Hard Disk (Come In Many Different Flavors and Quality Levels, Stores 
    All The Information In Your Computer)</li>
  <li> A Video Card (Cheap Stuff, Its What Your Monitor Plugs Into)</li>
  <li> IDE Controller Ribbon </li>
  <li> Miscellaneous Accessories</li>
</ol>
<p>Next we'll take a look at many of the different options you have when buying 
  these pieces of equipment. Your choice <br>
  may vary depending on which Operating Systems you plan on running.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Section #2 (Which Brand And Model Should I Buy?)</font></b></p>
<p>We'll lets start with your computer case and move all the way down to Miscellaneous 
  Accessories..</p>
<p><b>1. Computer Case</b></p>
<p>You will most certainly need an ATX style case with a quality power supply. 
  How do you tell? Well if the case<br>
  is only 15-20 bucks theres a pretty good chance its a crappy power supply. </p>
<p><b>2. A Mother Board</b></p>
<p>I suggest a quality ASUS (ATX style to match your computer case) mother board 
  its up to you ask your friends. <br>
  I've had bad experiences personally with FIC<br>
  mother boards.</p>
<p><b>3. A Floppy Drive and CDROM</b><br>
</p>
<p>Pretty inexpensive stuff, i'd suggest a Sony Floppy drive and a generic CDROM. 
  Doesn't make too much a difference if your<br>
  concerned about getting the best price.</p>
<p><b>4. Hard Disks</b><br>
  <br>
  Gets alittle tricky. If you want reliability, high speed transfers, and are 
  willing to run Windows I suggest a Western Digital<br>
  or a Seagate ULTRA DMA-66. If your not to concerned with speed and want to run 
  a server with Unix i'd go with a Fujitsu or<br>
  a Western Digital. Their farely inexpensive but only transfer in 33 megabit 
  bursts as apposed to the DMA-66 which transfer<br>
  in 33 megabit bursts. I don't believe Unix currently supports ULTRA DMA-66, 
  but don't quote me on that. Now there's an even faster <br>
  transfer rate available via SCSI Hard Disk Controllers, but i'm not about to 
  go into setting up SCSI controllers in this tutorial. <br>
  For now we will stick with IDE Hard Disk controllers.</p>
<p><b>5. Video Cards</b><br>
</p>
<p>Video cards are cheap and if your not a gamer a plain ole gener Cirrus Logic 
  or STB video card will do fine.</p>
<p><b>6. IDE Controller Ribbon</b><br>
</p>
<p>You'll need 2 different kinds of IDE Ribbon 2 40 pins for your CDROM and Hard 
  Disk and Another with less pins for your floppy.<br>
  You can buy these at any local computer store or order them off the web.</p>
<p><b>7. Miscellaneous Stuff</b><br>
</p>
<p>You may be interested in adding a sound card, ethernet card, and/or 3DFX card 
  to your system. These are relatively easy to do and<br>
  I will explain how to add card's to your mother board later. </p>
<p><b>Section #3 (Where do I buy all this crap!?)</b><br>
</p>
<p>Well if your looking for the best prices online for computer hardware (and 
  this is my unbiast opinion) i'd suggest going to<br>
  http://www.pricewatch.com again ask your friends maybe they know a better place. 
  Pricewatch.com researchs the best prices<br>
  on computer hardware.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Section #4 (Lets Assemble!)</font></b><br>
</p>
<p>This next part is very important so read carefully...</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p>First things first get yourself a clean desk to work on.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Place your ATX stlye computer case on the desk and slide/lift the top off. 
      Inside should be a bunch of wires coming out<br>
      of the power supply in the back and a bunch of wires coming out near the 
      face of the box.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
    The next thing your going to want to do is place your mother board inside 
    the case and fasten it in. Their might be<br>
    metal coverings covering the holes in the computer case were the parralel 
    ports and serial ports on the mother board<br>
    should poke through, go ahead and poke those out with a screw drive so you 
    can fit the mother board in snuggly. Every<br>
    Case fastens mother boards in different ways. Some use plastic pegs, some 
    use metal screws. It will hopefully be obvious<br>
    which you have to use. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
    #4 Once the mother board is mounted properly you will need to fasten the floppy 
    drive, and cdrom into the computer case.<br>
    All computer cases store floppy drives differently there maybe a slide out 
    container that you screw them into. You'll<br>
    have to make sure that the the floppy drive is right side up (duh!) and that 
    the pins are facing towards the back of the<br>
    computer. Installing the CDROM is pretty much the same in all computer cases. 
    Some mounting rails should have come <br>
    with your mother board. You need to fasten those to the sides of the CDROM 
    and you should be able to slide it right in<br>
    to one of the top bays. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
    Insert your Video Card. There are presently about 3 differnet forms of slots 
    on your mother board. PCI, ISA, and AGP.<br>
    Video Cards are presently made for all 3 of them. AGP stands for &quot;Accelrated 
    Graphics Port&quot; Video Cards made for this <br>
    slot are generally more high tech/performance. PCI's work and so do ISA (Althoug 
    ISA is more Old School). Gee how<br>
    do I tell the difference? Well AGP slots more than likely is the only small, 
    brown, slot on your mother board. PCI<br>
    you probably have the most of these their white and little longer than AGP. 
    ISA, these are longggg and black, ugly.<br>
    Insert your Video Card and snug it in there firmly. Don't force it (duh). 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
    Time for that evil Hard Disk installation. We'll Hit hooking up the power 
    supplies and Installing the Hard Disk at the<br>
    same time just for fun. Insert the Hard Disk In a very much similar way to 
    the way you inserted the floppy disk. But<br>
    Before you do make sure that the jumper settings are correct on the back of 
    Har Disk. Most hard disks are shipped in<br>
    single mode, but if you want to run multiple hard disks (which we won't discuss) 
    you need to set the jumpers differently.<br>
    Jumpers are little metal prongs connected with little jumpers that complete 
    a connection. You figure it out. Anyway<br>
    you got your hard disk in now its time to hook up the power supplies. The 
    hard disk and the CDROM have similar power supp<br>
    lies. 3 or 4 prong. Hook those funny looking cords coming out of the back 
    of the power supply into your CDROM and Hard<br>
    Disk. Theres a smaller one that hooks into your floppy it should be obvious. 
    Theres a big power supply (the biggest one<br>
    in the lot usually made of white plastic) It fits into a slot on your mother 
    board, it is the main power supply to your<br>
    mother board. Its kind of tricky to get in so be careful. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
    Now that you have your Power Supplies hooked up you'll need to connect your 
    Periphrials to your Mother Board. Use the IDE<br>
    Controller Ribbon I know you all have. Hey one end goes to your CDROM (make 
    sure the red line on the ribbon &quot;pin 1&quot; is <br>
    matched up with the first pin on the back of your CDROM) and the other end 
    goes to your mother board (same deal). The <br>
    same goes for your hard disk and yoru floppy. Figure it out its not that difficult. 
    You'll know you did something wrong<br>
    when you get a floppy disk fail on boot. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
    Finishing touches. Don't forget to connect those nasty wires coming out from 
    behind the face of your computer case to<br>
    your mother board. They control the on, off, reset, hard disk activity, and 
    power switch. Every mother board is different<br>
    so i hope you have a manual with your mother board. Most specify with 2 or 
    3 character paraphrases that make no sense.<br>
    For Example &quot;PWR SWT&quot; = Power Switch &quot;RST SWT&quot; = Reset 
    Switch. Or even more vague than that.
  </li>

<p><b><font size="4">Section #5 (Testing 1, 2, 3)</font></b><br>
</p>
<p>Ok your ready to give it a whirl, you'll need to get in your system bios. The 
  &quot;DEL&quot; key should usually get you in.<br>
  Get it to autodetect your hard disk. Accept the Setting and Save your Configurations. 
  Install Your OS and your ready to go.<br>
  That easy!! Ha! you'll prolly have lots of trouble theres a million resources 
  online to help you. Get to it.</p>
