a text on hardware for those of you sick of newbie tutorials, and looking for 
something interesting and non-dangerous. This is mainly about motherboard stuff,

<b><u><a name=#bios>The BIOS.</a></u></b><br>
This contains instructions which are specific for that particular motherboard. 
Those programs and instructions will remain in the PC throughout its life; usually 
they are not altered. However, it is possible to get replacement / upgrade BIOS's. 
Primarily the ROM code holds start-up instructions. In fact there are several 
different programs inside the start-up instructions, but for most users, they 
are all woven together. You can differentiate between: 
<pre>	* POST (Power On Self Test) 
	* The Setup instructions, which connect with the CMOS instructions 
	* BIOS instructions, which connect with the various hardware peripherals 
	* The Boot instructions, which call the operating system (DOS, OS/2, or Windows)</pre>
<br>
Note: Only very old or different OS's are stored on ROM, such as OS/2. This is 
actually a much more efficient system.<br>
BIOS's are static sensitive, so take care when handling them. They can also be 
PWord protected... if you ever get round to doing this, don't forget the password. 
As you don't use the BIOS PWord often, this is easy to do. Don't. it's bloody 
hard getting the PWord back. <br>
<br>
<b><u><a name=#processors>Processors</a></u></b><br>
Processors work on a fetch-execute cycle. each tick of the clock, in theory, they 
get a bit of data... and by tick of the clock here, we don't mean a second, we 
mean the tick of a computer clock. Depending on the speed of your processor, this 
is anywhere from 233 million ticks per second for a 233, to 800 for an overclocked 
600MHz Athlon chip. <br>
So, you can get, on your average computer, 400 - 500 bits of data per second. 
Well, wrong actually... because not every clock tick is taken up by getting the 
data. Every _fourth_ is. Well, what about every other 3? you ask.. they are taken 
up with _finding_ the data, _getting_ it, and putting it back. So, you say, your 
processor runs at a quarter of the speed that in theory it should be able to do? 
Well, yes. And there's no way around this, unfortunately. But, we can make the 
clock speed a little faster, and it is the clock speed that dictates the speed 
of the processor... (within reason). <br>
Therefore, you can set the clock ticks on your 233 to 266, and it'll run at 166 
MHz. Yes. Unfortunately, the more clock ticks there are in relation to what your 
chip is _supposed_ to run at, the hotter it Gets. Therefore, you need to install 
heatsyncs/fans. In fact, the AMD Athlon 600MHz overclocked to 800MHz, the fastest 
PC at the time of writing has a minature fridge that cools the chip, which is 
its own special metal box. The tower-sized case also has a box the size of a mini-tower 
underneath for the cooling system. ;) <br>
For this increase in temperature of 200MHz, the chip is cooled to -37 degrees 
centigrade. that's cold. ;) (Note: AMD chips generally run a lot hotter than Intel 
ones). ((Not a problem unless u have no heatsync)) - see the micron section, below...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u><a name=#clock>The Clock</a></u></b><br>
Now, this fabled clock looks like, in most cases, a small black box on your motherboard. 
The clock ticks it emitts are in the form of a wave <like oscilloscope an on see 
you?d what>, but a different wave: one that is sqare, and it looks like a castle 
ramparts. the speed of this is dictated by the MHx setting you set with the Jumpers 
on your motherboard. The waves look like so: (except slightly more square) 
<pre>  __     _    ____   _   _    ___
_¦  ¦___¦ ¦__¦    ¦_¦ ¦_¦ ¦__¦   ¦__    and etc.

</pre>
<br>
The wave, which never changes, and is always the same, is broadcast throughout 
your motherboard, and it synchronises all of the things that go on there. For 
example, when you press the left button in your game of quake, the processor assigns 
different bits of your computer <in card graphics primarily 
case, this>to do whatever is neccacery to redraw what's on the screen, and tells 
it to have it done in 3 ticks' time. The same process occurs on the gfx card itself, 
where the main processor assigns a polygon to each other chip, or whatever. Infact, 
if you have an old enough computer, you can see it being redrawn on the screen... 
try it... run a gfx-intensive game on a 486... If the task isn't done in time, 
then it all falls apart, and the computer crashes. This is why you don't want 
to buy a dodgy CPU. :) (Get an AMD Athlon!).<br>
The signals sent run around your motherboard, through all of those copper bits, 
and into the chips, ISA slots, or whatever, and the task gets accomplished. <br>
<br>
This signal is sent around the motherboard in that most wonderful of things we 
all love, Binary. Now, Binary is what Computers communicate with, and it is a 
DIGITAL thing. Digital. A Much used term.<br>
COmputers are electronic, and therefore, all the signals in them are tiny pulses 
of electricity. Now, electricity can be one of two things. On... or off. And this 
is what makes it digital. If it could be half on as well, it would be analogue... 
But no. It's digital. However, the representation of it in the form of signals 
down wires is analogue, as a sound in a modem wire can be any of a hundred million 
different pitches, can't it. Yes. This digital signal is, then, a series of 0's 
and 1's. Binary. The counting system that we use (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11... etc... ) is Denary. It's Base ten... Binary is Base 2 (and Hexadecimal, 
which is used, amongst other things, is base 16). Therefore it is perfect for 
being what these signals are coded in. so each charactor on your screen is represented 
in your computers RAM by a series of Binary digits. Probably 8. if you go into 
Windows Calculator, and switch to scientific mode (View&gt;Scientific) you can 
decode this. For example, 1 in Binary is 00000001. 2 is 00000010. The way this 
can be decoded is thus: <br>
<br>
Each digit in binary represents a quantity of a certain number, just as denary 
does. In denary, there is a column for 1's, a column for 10's, and a column for 
100's. <etc..>And in Binary, there is a column for 1's, 2's, 4's, 8's, etc. Let 
me show you: <br>
<br>
Denary:<br>
<table>
  <tbody> 
  <tr> 
    <td>100s</td>
    <td>10s</td>
    <td>1s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody> 
</table>
<br>
Here, there is a one in the hundreds column, and therefore, 100 + 0 + 0 (0 and 
0 are the other 2 columns) makes 100. SO 1 0 0 in Denary represents 100. (of course, 
translating 100 --&gt; 100 doesn't work, as denary is used in both cases). In 
Binary, this works this:<br>
<br>
Binary (8-bit -- 8 digits)<br>
<table>
  <tbody> 
  <tr> 
    <td>128</td>
    <td>64</td>
    <td>32</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody> 
</table>
<br>
SO... 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 250.<br>
So the Binary number 11111010 = 250. Simple, eh?<br>
<br>
It is possible to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, in fact, EVEYTHING 
that is possible with denary (1--&gt; 10)... I'm not going to explain it because 
it is simply too complicated. ;) Use Windows Calculator... the radio buttons at 
the top left switch between number systems.<br>
<br>
<b><u><a 
name=#chipset>Chipset</a></u></b><br>
We all know what assembly language is, do we not? It is the programming language 
that is most native to a computer. The instructions go directly to the chip (more 
or less). (Assembly actually lays on top of Machine code, which is the real native: 
Assembler is a more human-friendly version)... Each chip has their own different 
version of assembler/machine code, called its _chipset_. Each new type of chip 
comes with an upgraded chipset: for example, the Intel MMX chip incorporated the...wait 
for it... MMX chipset! There are also chipsets such as 3D!Now. THe most basic 
of commands between, say, Intel and AMD are the same: they have to be in order 
for the two to be compatible, but more advanced things are different. This is 
why Alpha chips are incompatible with windows: The chipset is completely different.<br>
Intel has hitherto been the leader in supplying chip sets to the Pentium motherboard. 
Therefore, let us just mention their chip sets, which have astronomical names. 
The Neptune chip set (82434NX) was introduced in June 1994. It replaced the Mercury 
set (82434LX). In both chip sets, there were problems with the PCI bus. In January 
1995 Intel introduced the first Triton, where everything worked. This chip set 
supports some new features: it supports EDO RAM, and it offers bus master integrated 
EIDE control and NSP (Native Signal Processing - one of the many new creations, 
which was soon forgotten). <br>
The sorts of things that new chipsets are used for are varied... for example, 
The Intel TX Chipset, for example, supports SDRam and UltraDMA (But the TX-set 
cannot cache above 64 MB RAM, and that is a problem.), while AMD chips have their 
own special Graphics chipset, which is better for that task.<br>
<br>
<b><u><a name=#microns>Microns</a></u></b><br>
The CPUs have doubled their calculating capacity every 18 months. This is called 
"Moore's Law" and was predicted in 1965 by Gordon Moore. He was right for more 
than 30 years. The latest CPUs use internal wiring only 0.25 microns wide (1/400 
of a human hair). But if Moore's Law has to be valid into the next century, more 
transistors have to be squeezed onto silicon layers. And now there is a new hope. 
IBM has for the first time succeeded in making copper conductors instead of aluminum. 
Copper is cheaper and faster, but the problem was to isolate it from the silicon. 
The problem has been solved with a new type of coating, and now chips can be designed 
with 0.13 micron technology. The technology is expected later to work with just 
0.05 micron wiring! Texas Instruments announced on August 27th 1998 that they 
expect 0.07 micron CMOS processing in the year 2001. At the time of writing, AMD 
chips run at .27 microns (?) and Intel at .33. This explains why AMD chips are 
hotter, as there is less wire, and therefore more probability of the electrons 
that the electricity is comprised of hitting the side of the wires, and creating 
heat.<br>
<br>
<b><u><a name=#hard>Hard Drives</a></u></b><br>
Hard drives work in much the same way as a floppy disk does. They can, however, 
store a much larger capacity of data, and therefore are much more fragile, and 
compact <on surface disk the>. For this reason, they are hermetically sealed. 
NEVER OPEN ONE IF YOU WANT TO USE IT AGAIN. There is, inside, 3 or 4 goldy-brown 
circular plates on which the data is stored. These are much the same as the ones 
inside a floppy disk, except that they are not 'floppy' but hard, or stiff. The 
data is stored on the platters magnetically, which explains why floppy disks have 
a "keep magnets away from me" warning on boxes u buy them in.<br>
IBM introduced the first hard disk in 1957, when data usually was stored on tapes. 
The first 305 RAMAC (Random Access Method of Accounting and Control) consisted 
of 50 platters, 24 inch diameter, with a total capacity of 5 MB, a huge storage 
medium for its time. It cost $35,000 annually in leasing fees (IBM would not sell 
it outright) and was twice the size of a refrigerator.<br>
In the early 80s, HD's became the preferred storage medium as opposed to floppy 
drives (these were previously used due to increased reliability). IBM's PS/2 (one 
of which I have - yay) was one of the first PCs to be equipped with a Hard drive. 
I think.<br>
<br>
<b><u><a 
name=#mice>Mice</a></u></b><br>
Mice are, as we all know, Input devices, and as we also know, they tell where 
you are on the mousemat by moving a ball in the bottom. Which you can see. But 
how does it read how the ball is moving? Well, inside the mouse are 2 rollers, 
at 90 degrees to each other. When you move the mouse, u move the ball, and thus 
the rollers. THe rollers have some little discs on the end of them with slits 
in, and either side of the disc are light-readers, so that when you move tha ball, 
the mouse can tell because light flasles on and off in its light reader. There 
is also a 3rd non-functional roller to keep the ball rolling smoothly. Note: It 
is perfectly safe to turn your mouse upside down ,. take the ball out and look 
inside, as long as you don't prod anything too hard (twiddle the rollers by all 
means, just don't stick bits of paper in there). It is also a good idea to get 
a blunt knife or screw driver and clean the crud off the rollers every few weeks... 
it solidifies into little rings around the rollers, and works to the detriment 
of the mouse. If it isn't cleaned off, it can also, fallinto the mouse, and reak 
havok with the insides. :) The same sort of crud builds up in keyboards, but is 
harder to remove. ;)<br>
<br>
<b><u><a name=#gfx>GFX Cards</a></u></b><br>
A video card is typically an adapter, a removable expansion card in the PC. Thus, 
it can be replaced! The video card can also be an integral part of the system 
board...This is the case in certain brands of PCs and is always the case in lap 
tops. This is not nice, as it is hard to upgrade to a better card. On a OC with 
a non-removable gfx or sound card, the normal procedure if you _do_ want to replace 
it is to disable the built-in graphics card using jumpers or dip switches... consult 
your motherboard manual. ;) Regardless of whether it is replaceable or integrated, 
it consists of three components: <br>
<br>
* A video chip of some brand (ATI, Matrox, S3, Cirrus Logic, or Tseng, to name 
some of the better known). The video chip creates the signals, which the screen 
must receive to form an image. <br>
* Some kind of RAM (EDO, SGRAM, or VRAM, which are all variations of the regular 
RAM). Memory is necessary, since the video card must be able to remember a complete 
screen image at any time. <br>
* A RAMDAC - a chip converting digital/analog signals. <br>
<br>
NOTE: Never buy an S3. Never. Ever. I've had lots, they're all useless. Remember 
that.<br>
<br>
All ordinary graphics cards can show 3D games. That is really no special trick. 
The problem is to present them smoothly and fast. If the PCs video card is made 
for 2D execution only, the CPU must do the entire workload of geometric transformations 
etc.! And that task can cause even the fastest CPU to walk with a limp. In recent 
years there has been an enormous development in 3D graphics cards. Let me briefly 
describe those here.<br>
<br>
There are two types of graphics cards, which can be used for 3D acceleration: 
<br>
<br>
Combination 2D/3D cards. These are ordinary graphics cards, which have been equipped 
with extra 3D power. <br>
The pure 3D cards, which only work as accelerators. These cards require that there 
also is an ordinary (2D) graphics card in the PC. <br>
Of course the pure 3D card yields the best acceleration, but there are also good 
combination cards on the market. <br>
