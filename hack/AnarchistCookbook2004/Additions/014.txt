THE PROFESSIONAL SYSTEM
This method relies on a staking plan and its success depends upon following the instructions exactly!
Your aim will be for target profit, T, of 5 points per race. I use a bank of £200 and give each 'point' a 50p or £1 value. Once you have decided the amount you wish to nominate for each 'point', this should never be altered during a racing sequence.
It is only a matter of time before you have a win even if you know nothing about racing. The reason you have to settle for a relatively low cash value for each point is that this amount multiplies on each loser. Lets imagine you had ten losers in a row, if you had given each point a value of £1 per point then your stake for the 11th bet would be to recover £55. If you had given each point a value of 25p then you would be aiming to recover £10.25. Consider the risks you are taking and compare this with the profit you wish to make!
This system has been used for many years by those who do not believe in gambling. They believe in racing as a business. Now the secrets of the methods are yours!
T =Points target for race
T+L = Target + Loss (if losing)
OR Target - Gain (if winning)
S = Stake
R = Result
W = Points won that race
L = Points lost that race
AWS + Running total of accumulated WINS and LOSSES
Target profit reached, start sequence again
RACE T T+L S R W L AWL 
1 05 05 2 L - 2 -01 
2 10 12 4 L - 4 -06 
3 15 21 7 L - 7 -13 
4 20 33 11 2-1 22 - +09 
5 25 16 5 L - 5 +04 
6 30 26 9 1-1 09 - +13 
7 35 22 7 L - 7 +06 
8 40 34 11 4-1 44 - +50 
9 0 05 2 L - 2 -2

As you can see, in race 8, the target profit of 40 points was reached and exceeded. At this point all the profit is withdrawn and the sequence started again with 5 points as the target. 

To calculate the race stake, divide by T+L by 3 to the nearest whole number. Then to win at 3-1 or over will clear ALL outstanding losses AND give the expected profit.
Many professionals advise against using odds-on prices or anything below evens, and I would say that if you follow the instructions you should not need to bet on anything less than evens.
You could, if you wish, pay the betting tax on each race by adding it to the target for the next race. In this way the method would pay your tax as well.
You do not need to bet on each race however many Professionals bet on every race at any given meeting every day. For example there may be 6 races at a meeting and six days racing, therefore a total of 36 bets in a week.
My advice is select your races carefully or better still subscribe to an advice service. Beware of newspaper tips and naps. One 'expert' gave over thirty losers on the trot. Although this is rare, it can happen, and if the target is too high, this run can be uncomfortable.
Alternate your bets with three or four bookmakers as no bookmaker will absorb winning bets over a lengthy period.
Whatever stake you use remember that a single win of 3-1 or over will clear ALL outstanding losses AND give the EXPECTED PROFIT!
