  preface:
  -------

    the gun which I am about to explain how to build is an original style zip-
 gun. Other zip-guns have been made, but most have been of inferior quality
 and are very dangerous to operate. The gun I have constructed is easy to use
 and safe to operate.

  History:
  -------
    zip-guns where used during the gang war era because of their easiness to
 build and their small size. Many prisoners of have been known to construct
 zip-guns while in jail (but I have not heard of any prisoner escaping using
 a zip-gun).

  ===========
  -Materials-
  ===========

    you will need:
    -------------

  (1) ball point pen - approximately 5.3 Inches long (metal).

  (1) Strong spring - approximately 1.59 Inches long (able to fit inside
      2nd half and a little bit of the first).

  (1) Strong metal bar - approximately 2.5 Inches long (able to fit
      inside pen).

  (1) Strong small metal bar (a little bigger then the circumference of
      the spring and able to slide easily thru the 2nd half of the pen).

   A few .22 Caliber bullets.

    Optional:
    --------

  (1) soldering iron.

  ==============
  -Construction-
  ==============

   -please note: diagrams not to scale.

    First untwist the ball point pen and take out all the insides (you may
 break them to get them out because they are not needed and should be
 discarded (see diag. A).

 -The pen (diag. A)-

       --------------------------
     -<             +           :*]
       --------------------------
             ^             ^
          1St half      2nd half

      < denotes pen tip (where the ink comes out).
      + Denotes middle (separation point of pen).
     *] denotes push button.

    Now take the metal bar (larger one) and attach it to the push button (see
  Diag. B).

 -Firing pin (diag.B)-

      --------------------*
               ^          ^
          metal bar   push button

    you can attach it by either shoving the metal bar into the bottom
 or by soldering it in place (please note: I recommend soldering the metal
 bar in place). Important - the metal bar must be attached in the exact
 middle of the push button (the metal bar will act as a striking pin and
 must be in the exact center so it will strike the middle of the bullet
 causing the bullet to go off).
    With the metal bar now firmly attached to the push button, put the
 push button inside the pen like it should be (see diag. C).

 -Firing pin placement (diag. C)

                2nd half

    -B- denotes metal bar.
      : Denotes middle (separation point of pen).
     *] denotes push button.

    Now take the spring and slide it over the metal bar (see diag.D).

    -B- denotes metal bar.
      : Denotes middle (separation point of pen).
     *] denotes push button.
      X denotes spring around metal bar.

    Now with the spring around the metal bar and the push button where it
 Should be, attach (by soldering or twisting, soldering preferred) the
 small metal bar to the metal bar (see diag.E).

     *] denotes push button.
      X denotes spring around metal.
      ^ denotes small metal bar attached to metal bar.

    Note: it might also be helpful to solder the small metal bar to the
  Spring along with soldering it to the metal bar.

  ==========================
  -Test of firing mechanism-
  ==========================

    pull back push button as far as it will go while holding onto the second
 half of the pen. Now let go and the metal bar (longer one) should snap
 forward and then return to its approximate starting position.

  ==============
  -Finishing up-
  ==============

    placement of bullet:
    -------------------

    a .22 Caliber bullet should now be placed in the 1st half of the "pen"
 approximately 1 1/2 millimeters in front of where the metal bar would
 be if the "pen" was put back together. Be sure to tape (or whatever you think
 will work) the bullet inside the casing or else the bullet, if moved,
 might go off accidentally (see diag.F).

 -Bullet placement (diag. F)-

      ---------------------------
            ^            ^
         1St half     2nd half

    -B- denotes metal bar.
      : Denotes middle (sepearation point of pen).
     *] denotes push button.
      X denotes spring around metal bar.
      ^ denotes small metal bar attached to metal bar.

  How to operate:
  --------------

    Pull back on push button as far as it will go, then let go - the bullet
 has just been fired (easy, right?).
    If you wish to shoot another bullet, untwist the "pen", take out the
 shell and reload (see placement of bullet).

  Notes:
  -----

    the bullet will tumble when shot instead of the spiraling because the
 inside of the 1st half (the barrel) has no lands or grooves. Tumbling
 is good because the bullet will rip thru a target, but it does cause the
 bullet to be off target approximately 3-4 inches. Having no lands or grooves
 makes the bullet hard to be traced back to its source (no striations).
 If you wish to make lands and grooves, you can by taking a screw and
 twisting it inside the 1st half of the "pen" (adds striations to bullet).
    I would also advise you to cut off the tip of the "pen". If the tip is
 left on, the bullet will still shoot, but it will blow thru the tip and send
 pieces of the pen flying in different directions (also causing the bullet to
 be off target.)

 -Optional: diagram-removal of tip-

        /

      < denotes tip (where ink used to come out).
      : Denotes middle (separation point of pen).
      / Denotes where tip should be removed (just enough to let the
        bullet shoot out).

  ============================
  -Advantages & disadvantages-
  ============================

  disadvantages:
  -------------

    (1) one shot capacity-only one bullet can be shot at a time (you must
        reload the gun everytime you want to shoot).

    (2) Not as accurate as a regular .22 Caliber gun (but the gun was not
        intended for target shooting).

    (3) Looking like a pen may cause dangerous situations.

  Advantages:
  ----------

    (1) easy to build.

    (2) Easy to use.

  (3&4) Easy to conceal and discard.

    (5) Low cost (almost nothing).
