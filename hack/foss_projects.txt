This is a list of more or less known open-source projects useful for
all kinds of reverse engineering, code behavior analysis, binary
forensics, debugging and so on. I wanted to create a comprehensive
list that includes very basic tools, but also some unique, not very
popular, yet promising and interesting one-of-the-kind projects.
I found it pretty annoying there is no good refernce list like this,
and pretty often we have to reinvent the wheel every time we want
to complete some obscure task. Unlike some other "rev-eng" lists (e.g.
the one at packetstorm), this avoids listing many almost completely
similar tools - twenty fuzz tools, fifty gdb GUIs, one million malloc
tracers. I am also not going to put tools like source browsing utilities
or source analyzers, because they are of very little value in such
work, unless you want to find obvious bugs in someone else's sources,
which is a whole different issue.

Please mail me with any submissions or corrections at <lcamtuf@coredump.cx>.
