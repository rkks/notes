how to search google for RAPIDSHARE links


If you wanna find some apps, files etc on rapidshare.de via google, do the following.

Paste this into the google search window (not the adress bar):

site:rapidshare.de -filetype:zip OR rar daterange:2453402-2453412

* this searches the site rapidshare.de for any file that is rar or zip, and
has been indexed between 1-11 February.

dvd site:rapidshare.de -filetype:zip OR rar daterange:2453402-2453412

* this is the same search but it specifically searches for "dvd" with the same
search criteria, so any app posted with the word dvd in it will be found.

There are mainly three criteria to keep in mind when doing this search.

1. site: your site of choice to search

2. filetype: filetypes you wanna search,if you put a "OR" after the first
filetype you can add more.

3. daterange: (start date-enddate)

* this uses the "julian calendar", converter can be found here:
