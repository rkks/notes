If you would like to keep a particularly interesting chat that has scrolled by but is still in your buffer there is a way to save it! Type "ALT -" (alt minus) to enter the system menu under the top left little icon thingy above every channel or private conversation. In this menu select the Buffer/Save As/ entry and save your buffer to a file. Succes! 

The LOCK feature in mIRC allows you to minimize mIRC and lock it with a password for strange eyes. If you control-minimize mIRC (keep the Ctrl-key pressed down while minimizing mIRC), it will be locked with your password. If no password was set previously mIRC will ask you for one. Later when you want to maximize mIRC you need your password to activate it. An extention of this feature in the /File/Options/General/Lock/ menu can be used to lock mIRC or certain channels for your children!

ALT + Minus Press the key combination ALT and 'minus' simultaneous to access the windows' System Menu's (found under that little horizontal bar in every top left corner of ANY window in mIRC and windows). Here you can set the fonts you like, the logging options, save the buffer and set various other things for private and channel conversations. 

/clear Use the /clear command to flush away all old text you dont want to read again. /clearall clears all text in all windows!

/channel The /channel command will open the Channel Central that displays all modes and bans set on your current channel. 

/pdcc Use the undocumented /pdcc [on|off] command to speed up your DCC sessions! It will pump a certain amount of your data packages away to the reciever, ahead of the confirmation of their arrival. Try it, it works  .
