 Manage Saved IE Passwords


When you enter a user name and password, Internet Explorer may ask if you want it to remember the password. Click on Yes and it will automatically fill in the password next time you enter that user name. But if you check Don't offer to remember any more passwords, then whether you click on Yes or No, you won't be prompted again. To recover this feature, launch Internet Options from IE's Tools menu, select the Content tab, click on the AutoComplete button, and check Prompt me to save passwords.

To delete an individual saved password entry, go to the log-on box on a Web page and double-click. Your saved AutoComplete entries will drop down. Use the arrow keys to scroll to the one you want to delete, and press the Del key.
