if($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] == "SoD")
 print "owns you!";
else
 print "don't front!";

Description: Instead of calling files like ( index.php?str=blah ) , you could do ( index.php?SoD ) and it would print out "owns you!". You can add more strings in there, this is just an example.



   $vars = explode(",", urldecode(getenv('QUERY_STRING')));
   $v1 = array_shift($vars);
   $v2 = array_shift($vars);
   $v3 = array_shift($vars);

   switch ($v1) {
       case 'first.1': {
           print("This is v1, first string case 'file.php?first.1'.");
           break;
           }
      case 'first.2': {
      switch ($v2) {
           case 'second': {
               switch($v3) {
                   case 'third': {
                     print("This is v3, the last case 'file.php?first.2,second,third'.");
                     break;
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       }
   }


Description: This basically does what the 1st one does but with more strings and a different seperator rather than '&'. I don't really want to go into too much detail on the thread so if people are confused or need explaining, reply or PM me.

That's it for the navigation as I am not going to do the other due to they're everywhere else and I wanted to be different and show everyone this method.
