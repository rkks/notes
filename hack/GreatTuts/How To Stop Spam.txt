NOTE: If you stop the service and don’t adjust the startup type, the Messenger service will start automatically the next time you reboot. Keep in mind that when you disable the Messenger service, you'll no longer receive messages about an attached UPS, and you won’t be notified of print job completion, performance alerts, or antivirus activity (from Windows) not the program you're using for those purposes.

6. Example 6

1. To disable receipt of messenger pop-ups, verify that your firewall disables inbound traffic on UDP ports 135, 137, and 138, and TCP ports 135 and 139. On a system connected directly to the Internet, you should also disable inbound traffic on TCP port 445. If the system you want to protect is part of a Win2K-based network with Active Directory (AD), don't block incoming traffic on port 445 - Mcft Knowledge Base Article - 330904
Code:

NOTE: You can use the firewall approach only if your system doesn't communicate with legacy systems that rely on NetBIOS name resolution to locate machines and shared resources. If, for example, you let users running Windows 9x share your printer or scanner, when you disable inbound NetBIOS traffic, users won't be able to connect to these shared resources. Regardless of the method you choose, you can stop messenger spam

2. Program

1. Example 1

NOTE: On Oct 15, 2003, Mcft releases Critical Security Bulletin MS03-043 warning users that the Windows Messenger Service running and exposed by default in all versions of Windows NT, 2000 and XP, contains a "Remote Code Execution" vulnerability that allows any not otherwise secured and protected Windows machine to be taken over and remotely compromised over the Internet
1. Shoot the Messenger
Code:

2. Example 2

1. Messenger Disable
Code:
http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/MessengerDisable.zip

NOTE: If you choose to uninstall Windows Messenger on a system with SP1 installed, you will receive an error message about "un-registering" an OCX file. This is normal, and doest not affect the removal process. Windows Messenger will still be removed

3. TEST

1. Example 1

1. Right-click "My Computer"
2. Select "Manage"
3. Under "System Tools" right-click on "Shared Folders"
4. Choose "All Tasks" and select "Send Console Message..."
5. If you recieve the following error message then the service has been disabled, otherwise confirm that you have disabled it or try another example
"The following error occured while reading the list of sessions from Windows clients:
Error 2114: The Server service is not started."

2. Example 2

1. Click Start then "Run"
2. Type in {cmd.exe}
3. Type in net send 127.0.0.1 hi
4. If you get a popup "hi" message, then confirm that you have disabled it or try another example

4. IF YOU INSIST

1. If you insist on keeping Windows Messenger, then I'd recommend Messenger Manager - "Allows you to keep your messenger service running, as is intended and needed by Windows. This ensures that vital system errors and notifications may be sent informing you of Important System Events"
Code:

2. However, as a replacement to Windows Messenger remote control feature, I'd recommend this free tool Virtual Network Computing - "It is a remote control software which allows you to view and interact with one computer (the "server") using a simple program (the "viewer") on another computer anywhere on the Internet. The two computers don't even have to be the same type, so for example you can use VNC to view an office Linux machine on your Windows PC at home"
