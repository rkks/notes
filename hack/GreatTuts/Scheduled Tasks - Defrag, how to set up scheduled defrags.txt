Scheduled Tasks - Defrag, how to set up scheduled defrags


oi m8s i figured this out because i ran into problems with trying to get windows task manager to defrag my hardrive at a certain time by only using built in tools.

Step 1

open up notepad (or favorite editor) and type:


defrag c:
defrag d:
defrag e:
defrag f:
defrag g:
defrag j:


make sure to change the drive letters to one that match your system. After you have customized the drive letters save the file as defrag_script.BAT or whatever is easy for you to remeber. Just make sure its a ".BAT" file. I saved the file into a dir in my documents called scripts but you can put it anywhere.

Step 2

Now that you have the script already made open your control panel and click on "Scheduled Tasks".

Select file>new>Scheduled Task

it should create a file on oin the window called "New Task" slect this and right click to properties.

In the run box click browse and navigate to your script. make sure that you run it with an account that has administrator rights otherwise it might not work.

Now select the schedule tab from the top and input the time and how often. I chose to urn it every noght however you could probably run it once a week and still be fine.

After yo uset the time and how often have a look in the settings tab and see if you need to change anything. Then click okay and your done!


you can also modify the script further by adding various operations on the ends of the defrag command:
CODE

-a  Analyze Only
-f Force defragmentation even if free space is low
-v verbose output
-? Display help text


You can also pipe the command defrag to a log file if you want to see what went on the last time the script ran:
CODE

--this form will rewirte the log file erasing any previous info--
defrag x: -v > x:/logs/defrag_log.txt

--this form will append the new info to the end of the old--
defrag x: -v >> x:/logs/defrag_log.txt
