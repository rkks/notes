 Hello friends

May be this might be useful. I install 98 with backup/restore utility.

My way of auto installation of XP.
Then on second partition or the same partition XP without pagefile.sys.

Then i get a dual boot. So after booting into XP, Install all ur fav progies
n games. Test each of them, to make sure they work... etc etc... all
ur drivers also. Tweak ur xp.

make sure u unhide all files relates to win xp dir and progra files.

Then boot into 98 > goto backup utility of 98.

Select the folders used by XP, eg
my documents and settings
winxp (or windows- what ever name u gave to windows dir)
check all files in the root
program files folder
and like this all folders and files used by xp.

then start the backup process.

make sure u have ~ > 3gb of free space on the disk / partition
u r planning to save the image file.

Then when ur XP crashes or U crash it ... lol
then just boot into 98, goto restore option,
and click ok. Over write old files or new ones as u like.

It takes ~20min to install

U can exclude any folder, u think is not needed at that time for reinstallation.

The whole task id completed in 20 minutes ... in the mean while
I make a nice cup of tea for myself and wait for XP to start

PS: dont forget to include boot.ini file.

Hope it will help.
