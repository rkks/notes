We have seen a large number of computers coming in with problems navigation on the internet. Also unable to go to Windows update and viurs update sites. Here is a quick fix that also seems to speed navigation up some.

Just for safety create a copy of the file before making changes.

goto

C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\ (Windows XP)

C:\I386 (Windows 2000)

Open the host with notepad.

remove all entries bellow

127.0.0.1 localhost


then save and close
