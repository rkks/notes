INTRODUCTION
------------
    Unlike most of my previous text files this text file has been written for expirienced hackers.  What does that mean?  Well if you are a beginner that means you probably wont understand most of this and should not attempt to hack TRW.  If you are expirienced then go right ahead...


HACKING TRW
-----------
When you connect up to TRW, the dialup will identify itself with the
message "TRW".  It will then wait for you to type the appropriate answer-
back (such as CTRL-G).  Once this has been done, the system will print out
some numbers and then "CIRCUIT BUILDING IN PROCESS".  After this, it clears
the screen with a CTRL-L followed by a CTRL-Q.  After it sends you the CTRL-Q, it is ready for you to log in.  You first type in the 4 character identifying
code for the location you are.

SOME EXAMPLES ARE:
TCA1 - For certain California Subscribers.
TCA2 - A second California TRW system.
TNJ1 - A New Jersey Database.
TGA1 - A Georgia Database.

     You should then hit return.  On the next line, you must type your 3 character option.  Most requests use the RTS option.  OPX, RTX, and some others exist.  (Note: TRW accepts an A, C, or S as the X in some options.)  Then you would then type in a 7 digit subscriber code followed by a 3-4 character password.  It seems that if you manage to get hold of a TRW printout (by trashing a business), the subscriber code will be on it, leaving only a 3-4 character password for you to hack.

EXAMPLE LOGON
-------------
Set your communications program as follows:
Half Duplex, Even Parity, 7 Data Bits and 2 Stop Bits


ATDT 741-6016 
CONNECT 

System: TRW
User  : CTRL-G
System: -1017-101-

        Circuit building in process

        CTRL-L CTRL-Q

User  : TCA1 (RETURN)
System:
User  : RTS 1234567ABC (RETURN) CTRL-S

NOTE: If you: **system error** it just means you entered an invalid code, and it will start you over.

CONCLUSION

    That's it!  I hope this text file will be able to help you get started on hacking TRW.  If you have any problems and have access to the Internet I can be mailed at the following address:
