Make Your Own Ringtones For Mobile Phone,  also logos, wallpaper .etc ...

I have a Motorola V220 and want to have my own ringtones without down load from internet and PAID angry2.gif . After searching all night for "how to" ...this is what I got - after testing with my mobile...and it works very well. I want to share with you ...

A - Tools

1- You have to have a mobile phone which has USB connection (of course yu.gif )
2- a USB cable (whatever cable that can connect PC to your mobile, mine is a digital camera USB cable)

Softwares

1- MobilePhoneTools_1.23c
2- MobilePhoneTools_2.21b (updated)
3- p2k_driver_2.3 (for modem driver update)
4- USB_driver (just in case)

B - SETUP

1- Unzip and install MobilePhoneTools_1.23c
2- Update with MobilePhone_2.21b
3- Unzip p2k_driver into a folder
4- Connect your phone to PC
5. Windows will automatically detect the new hardware and open the "Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard"
6. Click "Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)", then click next.
7. On the next window, only choose "Include this location in the search", then click "Browse"
8. In the "Browse for folder" window, click on the folder you unzip "p2k_driver", then click "OK", then "Next"
9. Windows will search for the driver in that folder, and it is there ....BUT.....

10. A window pops up:

"The software you are installing for this hardware:

Motorola USB Modem

has not passed Windows Logo testing to verify its compatibility with Windows XP. (Tell me why this is important.{XP says this, I am not asking it})

Continuing your installation of this software may impair or destabilize the correct operation of your system either immediately or in the future. Microsoft strongly recommends that you stop this installation now and contact the hardware wendor for software that has passed Windows Logo testing."

Click "Continue Anyway"

11. After the wizard finds the driver, click "Finish"

C - Copy MIDI, WAV, MP3, PICTURES ...to mobile

After setup you can copy any your favours Midi, MP3, Wav etc ..to your mobile as your own Ringtones, wallpapers cheer.gif
