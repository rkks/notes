              Computerized Governmental Database Systems
                   Containing Personal Information
                                 And
                         The Right to Privacy
                                  by
                   Lewis William Oleinick, M.P.Af.
               The University of Texas at Austin, 1993
             SUPERVISORS: Chandler Stolp and Philip Doty

     This report identifies and examines the potential threats to
individual privacy created by the collection, aggregation, and
dissemination of personal information by governmental agencies and the
role computer systems play in potentiating such threats.  Computer
matching, computer profiling, the national criminal justice database,
and portfolio creation via data aggregation of personal information
are the governmental activities stipulated to be potentially
threatening to personal privacy.  These four activities are forms of
"dataveillance."  Dataveillance poses dangers to the security of civil
liberties in a free society.

     To carry on an intelligible discussion about privacy and how the
collection, aggregation, and dissemination of personal information by
governmental agencies may threaten individual privacy it is necessary
to first define privacy and personal information.  Independence,
autonomy, dignity, and respect create a conceptual framework upon
which privacy may be defined.

     Privacy is a culturally defined norm.  As such a discussion of
the American cultural tradition of privacy is necessary to understand
both how Americans have defined privacy over time and the roles
privacy has played in American society in 1) "starting over," 2) in
interpersonal relationships, and 3) in maintaining the "balance of
power" with the State.  Privacy is held to be as important as the
unalienable rights of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" by
the majority of the American public.  Americans have become more and
more concerned with their privacy as intrusive technologies have
evolved.  Many Americans fear that computers allow the U.S. Government
too much power over the average citizen.
     Privacy has been protected in the United States by

precedents set in court cases, by legislation and by executive act.
The breadth of cases pertaining to privacy precludes the examination
of all cases.  Supreme Court cases provide a historical overview of
the evolution of the right to privacy as the questions presented to
the Court have become more complex with the introduction of new
technologies into the law enforcement process.

     Congress has attempted to address the public's concerns of the
government's collection, aggregation, and dissemination of personal
information by passing legislation designed to protect individual
privacy.  The four major pieces of legislation passed by Congress for
the protection of the citizen's right to privacy are the Freedom of
Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Computer Security Act of 1987,
and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988.  The
Office of Management and Budget has produced regulations designed to
enforce the intent of the legislation promulgated by Congress.  These
regulations are contained in OMB Circular A-130 which details federal
information policy.

     This report concludes by suggesting the need for the
implementation of a Privacy Protection Board at the national level.
Such a board would be based on the model suggested by David Flaherty.

     The primary conclusion that should be drawn from this report is
that society as a whole must re-evaluate the existing paradigm of who
should be in control of personal information; i.e., should it be the
agency who collects it or should the power of control remain with the
individual about whom the information was collected.  This report
suggests that a certain modicum of control over the disclosure of
personal information should revert to the individual about whom the
information was collected.

ADMINISTRIVIA

If you have any additions, deletions, or changes to this list, please email
them to johnl@netcom.com.

I will post this list (and/or changes to the list) to the Internet List
<Net_Info@gibbs.oit.unc.edu> mailing list and Usenet news groups
alt.zines, alt.etext, alt.internet.services, and rec.mag.  It can also be
obtained via anonymous FTP from netcom.com as "/pub/johnl/zines/e-zine-list",
and via email (either single issues or subscriptions) from
 e-zines-request@netcom.com.

If you publish an e-zine, or know someone who does, please send a copy to
me and I'll add the relevant info to this database.

Comments, suggestions, changes, deletions, etc., are welcomed and encouraged.


WHAT IS A "ZINE"?

For those of you not acquainted with the zine world, "zine" is short for
either "fanzine" or "magazine," depending on your point of view.  Zines are
generally produced by one person or a small group of people, done often for
fun or personal reasons, and tend to be irreverent, bizarre, and/or esoteric.
Zines are not "mainstream" publications -- they generally do not contain
advertisements (except, sometimes, advertisements for other zines), do not
have a large subscriber base, and are generally not produced to make a profit.


FORMATS

Most e-zines listed here are in standard ASCII text format, which you can read
on just about any computer or terminal, and print on any printer.  A few are
available in PostScript for printing on a laser printer (or viewing on-screen
if you have a PostScript interpreter in your window system).  A small number are
available in some system-specific format (i.e., Macintosh HyperCard).


HOW DO I GET THE E-ZINES?

I have listed the various methods of access for each particular
e-zine.  Briefly, I use the following:

  FTP -- File Transfer Protocol
    Only accessible if you are directly on the Internet, or know of an
    FTP-mail server (I don't).  The host/pathname is given in the form
    (host:path) that certain FTPs (like NCFTP) can use directly; otherwise,
    you'd probably type "ftp host" and then "cd path" or some such.  All
    FTP sites listed accept anonymous logins (use "ftp" as username and your
    email address as password).

  E-Mail -- Electronic Mail
    You can usually request current or back issues via this address.  Sometimes
    a site will run a mail server that automates some of this work.
 Instructions
    are listed, if applicable.

  Usenet -- Usenet News
    Only accessible if your site carries the specific Usenet group.

  Gopher
    Only accessible if your site is directly on the Internet.  Try typing
    "gopher".  If it works, you have a gopher client, and can usually type
    "gopher host".

  Postal
    Last resort, or point of contact for zines that have paper editions.

  Phone
    Why?  I dunno; because it was there.

  CompuServe
    You know, that out-dated system that charges ridiculous rates.

  Other
    BBSes and other on-line systems the zine resides on.

Ego Project
 "This 'zine is a product of me and as such will contain anything I feel
  like putting in it.  Whatever I feel like putting in it shall include,
  but is not limited too, anything I feel applies to Gothdom in general.
  Album/single/tape reviews, book and movies reviews, etc. The Sisters of
  Mercy and the Mission are my main focuses, but since neither of them
  put out music on anything resembling a frequent basis I imagine other
  groups will be featured quite frequently."

 "FactSheet Five is the central clearinghouse of information about zines,

  Gunderloy of Rennsalaer, NY published 44 editions of F5.  Hudson Luce
  published issue #45.  Seth Friedman has published issue #46 onwards.

FUNHOUSE! -- The cyberzine of degenerate pop culture
 "Dedicated to whatever happens to be on my mind at the time I'm writing.
  The focus will tend to be on those aspects of our fun-filled world which
  aren't given the attention of the bland traditional media, or which have
  been woefully misinterpreted or misdiagnosed by the same.  FUNHOUSE! is
  basically a happy place, and thus the only real criteria I will try to
  meet is to refrain from rants, personal attacks, and flames -- and thus
  FUNHOUSE! is an apolitical place.  Offbeat films, music, literature, and
  experiences are largely covered, with the one stipulation that articles
  are attempted to be detailed and well documemnted, although this is no
  guarantee of completeness or correctness, so that the interested reader
  may further pursue something which may spark her interest."
