If you're one of the many people that NEVER use the "links" folder in your favorites and can't keep windows for re-creating it. Here's how:

[Start] [Run] [Regedit]

Registry Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\ Software\ Microsoft\ Internet Explorer\ Toolbar

Modify/Create the Value Data Type(s) and Value Name(s) as detailed below.

Data Type: REG_SZ [String Value] // Value Name:

LinksFolderName

Value Data: [Set the String Value to a blank string]

Open Internet Explorer and manually delete the Links folder from Favorites Menu. The Links folder will not be recreated. Exit Registry and Reboot.
