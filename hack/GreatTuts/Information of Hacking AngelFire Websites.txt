To Whom It May Concern,My name is DJ and my web page is located at http://www.angelfire.com/ky/LydianSociety/welcome.html. This weekend I left for a trip to NY, and when I got back I decided to edit my homepage.  Except when I entered my password it did not work.  I am fairly sure I have the right one but am not 100% certain.  I would have used the web based password retrieving system form your site but I have changed my E-Mail addresses as well, so the old ones are no longer available.  My new address is XLydeX@hotmail.com . If you would please send me my account information again so I can finally edit my page again, I would be greatful. Thank you.Lyde

The Angelfire Hack!
==============

Enough with the legal shit! Let's get to the hack! Ok... You know this lamer on the net and u
want to get him back and he's got a page on Angelfire! What do u do? You hack his page of
course! For those of you who don't know what Angelfire is it's a free web page service. The 
basic things u will need to hack an Angelfire account are:


/\/\/\/\ STEP 1 /\/\/\/\

The full url of this dood's page. Like http://www.angelfire.com/ca/lamer/index.html
or what ever the url is... Basically what the url says is his page is at angelfire.com 
in the State of California in a directory called lamer. Index is just the name of the 
specific page. It could be different, but it usually defaults to index.html for their 
main page if they didn't change it.

/\/\/\/\ STEP 2 /\/\/\/\

I know what ur saying... How could i hack an account with just the url!! Keep reading! On 
to step 2! Next up you need to find out this person's old email addy. Usually it's on their 
front page. Write it down! 

/\/\/\/\ STEP 3 /\/\/\/\

Now you've got their full url and their email address. Now you have to find their name on their 
page. Usually they fill u in on what their real names are so find it and write it down. This 
isn't necessary, but it makes the letter a lot more genuine...

/\/\/\/\ STEP 4 /\/\/\/\

With all this information write a letter to Angelfire sayin how unhappy u r! Angelfire's help 
mail is mail@angelfire.com. Make the letter sound like a REAL scenario. That's the trick to 
this hack. A little social engineering goes a long way in getting u what u want. Say something 
in your letter like you went on vacation and forgot ur dam password! Say that you changed your 
email address and your old addy is no longer available so the password retrievable form won't 
work because it's sending to an unavailable address. So you give them a new address to send 
the password to!! Check ur mail the next day and wallah!!! INSTANT ACCESS!!!
