The Objective
The objective is to move the Start button around on the task bar, or to remove it completely from the taskbar.

The Steps
Click twice on the Start button so it has the dotted line around it.
Then press the "Alt" and the "-" keys simultaneously.
This will bring up the option box that allows you to move or close the Start button. If you choose move, you will have to use the arrow keys to move it around the taskbar.

NOTE: Moving it doesn't stay if you move the entire start bar with your mouse, and ending task on explorer.exe or rebooting will put it back in the corner.
