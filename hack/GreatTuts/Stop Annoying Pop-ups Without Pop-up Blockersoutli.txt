Did you ever go to warez/cracks sites (which we all know is BAD!) only to be bombarded with 10 windows opening up at a time, with porn, spam etc?

I've discovered a VERY easy way to block about 90-95% of this sh!t, without using any pop-up stopping programs (I hate installing that garbage!).

This is for Internet Explorer 6.0, but I'm sure that it can work with other browsers if you take the time to fiddle around.

Here's how you do it...

1) Go to TOOLS and then INTERNET OPTIONS.

2) Click the SECURITY tab, move the slider up to HIGH and click APPLY.

This applies the highest security settings to IE, which blocks EVERYTHING, including JavaScript, Applets, and so on that pop-ups are based upon.

The catch is this... Some places like online banks and other web sites need these functions to work properly... So you'll need to re-enable one important thing...

1) Go to TOOLS and then INTERNET OPTIONS.

2) Click the SECURITY tab, CUSTOM LEVEL, scroll down to SCRIPTING, and under ACTIVE SCRIPTING, select the ENABLE radio button.

3) Click APPLY and you're pretty much done!

Note: This does NOT completely remove pop-ups and other annoyances, but it sure helps ALOT, without having to trash your computer with pop-up blockers
