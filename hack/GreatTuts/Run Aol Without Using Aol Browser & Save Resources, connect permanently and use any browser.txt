Just a note to say if you wish to run AOL without many of the features (including the interface) use the AOL Dialler (start menu-> AOL ) and set it to run in the System Tray.

When you click this new icon it connects you to the net without opening the browser just by entering your user/pass and you can then use any browser you like, although i think you will need to manually enter your Emails.

But it saves resources and is more reliable!!
