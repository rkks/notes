THEN:
Opera5&6 & Netscape6.x, 7.x, Mozilla 1.x and Mozilla Firefox 0.x
Please download FlashGet Opera Plug-in 1.1. Install this plug-in into ...\Opera\Plugins or ...\Netscape6\Plugins or ..\Mozilla\Plugins or ..\FireFox\plugins directory.

Netscape 6 does not support the same click monitoring methods used by FlashGet with previous versions of Netscape. They left out the features that have been there since Netscape Version 1.0. For now, you must either:
Right click the links and do "Copy Link Location".
Or, the plugins used for FlashGet's Opera click monitoring do work in Netscape--with some quirks and differences from the other click monitoring. Just install FlashGet's Opera plugins into the ...\Netscape\Plugins directory.

Menuitem "Download by FlashGet" in Mozilla FireFox
FlashGot is an extension for integrating FlashGet and Mozilla Firefox 0.9 or later. It is available on Mozilla Update. Note that some antivirus software may incorrecly claim that it has a virus, as it uses Visual Basic Script (.vbs) files when integrating with Internet Explorer. Thanks Giorgio Maone.

Customizing Opera's context-menus
=================================
Build #040912



What's this about?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using Opera 7.x one is able to customize the rightclick menus. That in
mind it's possible to add a menu item for "Download using FlashGet".
First you need to know, that every kind of menu entry in Opera is
saved as plaintext in standard_menu.ini in the Opera defaults folder
(normally C:\Program Files\Opera7\defaults). So, we need to modify this
file in order to add our FlashGet menu extension.



Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Opera 7.0 or above
- FlashGet 1.60 or above



Here we go!
~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Get the folder where Opera is installed. See the registry at

[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Netscape\Netscape Navigator\5.0, Opera\Main]
"Install Directory"="C:\\Program Files\\Opera7"

From here on I will use %opera% instead of the whole path we got
from the registry since we need to save this info into a variable
to use it in our program.

ATTENTION! Be sure to not use this variable in any files we modify!
Always use the whole path we got from the registry. Otherwise it
will mess up your Opera installation!


2) Goto this folder and copy

%opera%\defaults\standard_menu.ini

to

%opera%\profile\menu\standard_menu.ini


3) Open this file with a text editor and change the following:

- change the name (line 7) into "Opera Standard with FlashGet extension"
- search for the categories

"[Link Popup Menu]" and "[Image Link Popup Menu]"

and add the following line to both categories:

Item, "Download using FlashGet" = Execute program, "C:\Program Files\FlashGet\flashget.exe","%l"

That is a lowercase L after the last %

- save the file and start Opera


4) Goto "File/Preferences/Toolbars and Menus". In newer versions
it's called "Extra's/Preferences/Toolbars and Menus" and highlight
the new entry "Opera Standard with FlashGet extension" in the field
"Menu setup"


5) Press "OK" and that's it! Now you can download link-targets (both
text- AND image-links) by right-clicking on a link and choose
"Download using FlashGet".



Hint:
~~~~~
You can skip 4) and 5) if you add the following line into section [User Prefs]
of the file %opera%\profile\opera6.ini

Menu Configuration=%opera%\profile\menu\standard_menu.ini

This can easily be done using Nullsoft's NSIS Installer 2.0.
