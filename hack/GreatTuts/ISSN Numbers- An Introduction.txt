The brochure was prepared by the National Serials DataProgram (NSDP), the office within the Library of Congress whichassigns International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN.)  The brochuregives information about how the ISSN is used and how to obtain anISSN.  The brochure includes an ISSN application form.  Thisintroduction augments the brochure by clarifying some of therequirements for obtaining an ISSN, by further discussing ISSN useby the U.S. Postal Service, and by addressing some newly expandinguses of the ISSN, such as its use in bar codes and itsapplicability to electronic serials.The ISSN is an internationally recognized identification number forserials.  It can be thought of as the "social security number" ofthe serials world.  The ISSN is the serial counterpart of the ISBN(International Standard Book Number).  However, NSDP does notassign ISBN numbers.  ISBN are assigned by the R.R. Bowker Co., 121Chanlon Rd., New Providence, NJ 07874.NSDP is the U.S. center of the International Serials Data System(ISDS), the international body which coordinates assignment and useof the ISSN worldwide.  NSDP can only assign ISSN to serialspublished in the United States.  ISSN for serials published outsidethe United States are assigned by ISDS national centers located inthe country of publication, or by the ISDS International Centerlocated in Paris.  There are approximately 50 national centers inthe ISDS network.  For a referral to the appropriate center, pleasecontact the ISDS International Centre, 20, rue Bachaumont, 75002Paris, France. ISSN can be assigned to serials published in any medium.  DifferentISSN are usually required for each physical medium, e.g., print,electronic, sound recording, etc.  In order to be considered aserial all issues (except for volumes in unnumbered monographicseries) must carry unique numerical or chronological designations(e.g., Vol., No., and/or date) by which individual issues can beidentified and distinguished from each other. The requirement that each serial issues carry a unique designationapplies to electronic publications (e.g., CD-ROMs, electronicjournals), as well.  If an electronic publication is a dynamicdatabase, a bulletin board, or a listserv, it is probably noteligible for an ISSN, but in any case of doubt please contact NSDP.One major use of the ISSN in the United States is its use by theU.S. Postal Service as an identification number for certainpublications mailed at second class rates.  However, it is notnecessary to have an ISSN before applying for a second classmailing permit; the ISSN can be assigned or confirmed as part ofthe application process.  Also, merely printing the ISSN does notautomatically confer any special mailing status on a publication. For specific information about obtaining second class permits,consult your local postmaster. A growing use of the ISSN is in bar codes.  While the ISSN is notused in the UPC code (the code seen primarily on trade and massmarket titles) it is used in the EAN and SISAC bar codes.  In thesetwo codes, the ISSN constitutes the portion of the code thatidentifies the title of the serial.  Other data in various barcodes can represent the number or date of the issue, or the price. Bar coding of serials is further speeding the efficiencies inserial processing which can be realized through the use of theISSN.  For information about ISSN in the SISAC bar code, contactthe Serials Industry Systems Advisory Committee, 160 Fifth Ave.,New York, NY 10010 and for information about ISSN in the EAN code,contact the Uniform Code Council, 8163 Old Yankee Road, Dayton, OH45458.ISSN can be assigned to serials either before the first issue ispublished or after publication has begun.  ISSN requestors shouldallow about one month for NSDP to assign the ISSN and send it tothem by return mail.  There is no charge for an ISSN assignment.In 1992 an American ISSN friends group, called "AmIS" (as in theFrench pronunciation) was established to help defray the cost ofdues assessed the United States for participation in theInternational Serials Data System.  This dues obligation, one ofthe several means by which the ISDS International Center isfinanced, amounted to $100,000 in 1991, of which the Library ofCongress could pay only $55,000.  AmIS provides the opportunityfor those who share in the benefits of the ISSN to help ensureits financial viability.  Membership benefits include an annualreport containing news from NSDP and ISSN statistics from theprevious year, as well as receipt of other ISSN, and ISDSinformation. Subscriptions to AmIS can be arranged throughperiodical subscription agents such as Faxon, EBSCO, or a library'sregular agent.  Brochures listing categories of membership in AmISare available from NSDP.National Serials Data ProgramLibrary of CongressWashington, DC 20540-4160                                   8/31/92                ***Last update 6/8/93 (efm)****-- Nigel Allen                     ae446@freenet.carleton.caThe views expressed in this message are mine, not EFF's. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Dan Brown brown@eff.org  Sysadmin for The Electronic Frontier Foundation. Join EFF!
