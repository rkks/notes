<br>Insights into Security Dos and Don'ts
<br>Want to keep the bad guys out? This handy guide, Jack the Hacker Tells All: Insights into Security Dos
<br>and Don'ts relays the ins and outs of security implementation, as told by Jack the Hacker. In this guide,
<br>the reformed hacker cracks away at myths surrounding the implementation of a sound IT security plan
<br>and offers tips for your best bets for network security. Get a glimpse into the mind of the very people who
<br>break into your computer systems and intrude on your company's privacy.
<br>Taken from two chats sponsored by NetIQ–"Inside the Hacker's Mind"–Jack the Hacker Tells All will show
<br>you how to develop and implement a successful security strategy to protect your corporate network
<br>infrastructure. Learn about the security defenses, how to protect your organization and ways to respond
<br>to security threats before they become major incidents.
<br>Architecture
<br>We are about to start hosting our own Web server. Are the securities built into Windows NT 4
<br>enough or should we use a firewall?
<br>Jack_the_Hacker: If at all possible, always invest in a good firewall, as well as sound architecture for the
<br>Web server. If you are able to invest in an appliance firewall, buy one with three interfaces. If you can only
<br>invest in the software, then you should be able to fit a server with three NICs to create a buffer zone in
<br>which to put your Web server. One interface is for the Internet, with a second NIC for the internal private
<br>network and the third for a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). The security built into Windows NT 4 and Windows
<br>2000 hosts is good. But when subjected to numerous scans and cracking attempts, some default installs
<br>will be cracked within only a few minutes to an hour. That is why you should keep current security
<br>patches for the OS and applications that run on the server.
<br>Are there any known security issues with Windows 2000 Server running remote routing
<br>functioning as a VPN?
<br>Jack: To date, I have not yet worked on this ability of Windows 2000. I would recommend a more
<br>specialized VPN solution over the Windows 2000 solution. I am currently looking at the ISA product, and
<br>will be able to give you a better answer after some more testing with it.
<br>What are the basic areas I need to secure on a Web site?
<br>Jack: How many sites on attrition.org were defaced by the RDS script? Quite a few. The basic areas that
<br>I look to hardening are the OS by checking for current security patches and implementing them on a test
<br>machine before even throwing my site up. That is just for the Web server. For the perimeter defense, you
<br>should throw a firewall up and create the Web server into the DMZ.
<br>We have a connection that is monitored by our sister company. Very early in the morning, our
<br>bandwidth usage goes through the roof. We are not aware of anything running at that time. What
<br>would you recommend we use to determine what is occurring? Could someone be taking
<br>advantage of a security hole?
<br>Jack: The ever-present sniffer is your best friend. Put a sniffer on the link between you and the sister
<br>company. The problem may be a kit looking for other servers in a massive blast, a mis-configured server
<br>or a security hole, but the sniffer logs will let you know where to start..As far as NAT routing is concerned, can vulnerabilities be exploited even in this type of hidden
<br>internal network? Beyond just Trojan’s getting in?
<br>Jack: NAT (Network Address Translation) routing is another security measure that more companies are
<br>using. Taking over a router is still a mainstay in the cracking community. Just because someone can’t get
<br>to your internal network due to private addressing doesn’t mean that they will take another route to your
<br>systems. Your routers are still there for the taking.
<br>What is your idea of good security implementation?
<br>Jack: One in which policies had been set in place before the actual implementation. Set aside the test
<br>environment. Verify the patches that are installed on the machines don’t make them quit functioning.
<br>Make sure that policies are strictly adhered to, but the policies must be workable as well. Creating each
<br>and every one of your servers in C2 compliance will not work if you want them to talk to one another. You
<br>must make trade-offs to have the systems work coherently. A good process consists of a month or two of
<br>testing desired policies to determine what is feasible, followed by the architecture’s implementation.
<br>Are there any issues with implementing a NT domain in a DMZ? We want to set a Microsoft Cluster
<br>in the DMZ.
<br>Jack: Make sure that no one trusts that domain. You can set the cluster up in the DMZ. But remember
<br>what the risk is with the DMZ – the DMZ is going to be hacked.
<br>What are the advantages of using a VPN vs. a modem pool as far as security is concerned?
<br>Jack: A modem pool is usually not secured very well, and a war dialer can find the pool rather easily. The
<br>VPN uses encryption by its nature and can withstand most petty attempts at breaking it.
<br>What are the best methods to secure the internal network from disaffected users?
<br>Jack: Proper adherence to a security policy that involves Human Resources should minimize the risk.
<br>However, as empirical data shows that this may not be enough. Depending on how large the corporation
<br>is, this task grows exponentially. If the user had minimal access, then the security admin won’t have much
<br>to do. Close communications between HR and Security teams should lead to swift and effective
<br>severance of access. Again, it rolls back to a security policy than a technology issue.
<br>What do you think of using protocol control, such as frame relay connectivity for internal
<br>communications, within an enterprise and then have firewall and proxy control to limit/control
<br>access in and out of the enterprise through the Internet at large?
<br>Jack: This is a very good idea, but can be a very difficult and extremely costly implementation. The more
<br>complex your solution, the greater the likelihood is that you’ll have vulnerabilities in your infrastructure.
<br>Is there a definitive, or nearly definitive, way to secure an enterprise against hacking?
<br>Jack: Disconnect from the Internet, pull the modem banks and do no business. You also have to make
<br>sure that your initial implementation of your architecture is sound. Make sure that security policies are in
<br>place and employees adhere to them. No rogue servers should be allowed onto the network.
<br>Development networks should have firewalls on them to segment them away from other departments, as
<br>well as maybe the accounting and finance areas. At the same time, try not to make the architecture too
<br>complex. You have to find a happy medium, one that is secure but also allows communications to occur..We are currently using dual firewalls configured for high availability, security routers and a packet
<br>shaper that is doing some filtering. Do you think that we also need to use IDS (Intrusion Detection
<br>Systems) on top of this to secure our environment?
<br>Jack: From what it sounds like, your current architecture is quite sound. I think the IDS would help you
<br>find out some internal activity, but it sounds like you aren’t letting a lot get through. That is a pretty 
<br>secureenvironment.
<br>How do you suggest better protecting servers in a DMZ?
<br>Jack: DMZ servers are your “sacrificial lambs.” These are the servers that you hope don’t get hacked, but
<br>will eventually find their way to the ATTRITION mirror. Here are some steps you can take. First, patch the
<br>systems very quickly after advisories come out and you test them for your environment. You must make
<br>sure the servers in the private network never get hacked. Next, use encrypted channels as often as you
<br>can. And finally, harden the OS to disallow easy hacks and tighten the ACL (Access Control Lists) on the
<br>routers to allow only trusted traffic.
<br>Can you talk about what defenses we should establish in order to prevent an attack (i.e. SP's, hot
<br>fixes, additional software)?
<br>Jack: Those defenses deal with the OS, the root of all evils. An application cannot run without its OS.
<br>Now, keeping up with Service Packs and hot fixes is a main staple to all IT and Security personnel. This
<br>helps you keep track of most of the new hacks coming out for which script kiddies have tools. But
<br>remember – test them first to see if they develop other problems with your applications. Some additional
<br>software that could be looked into is quality control for your home-brewed applications. Make sure your
<br>developers adhere to strict coding guidelines that don’t introduce buffer overflows.
<br>Would you say that using an IP address from the 10.0.0.0 range on your internal networks is a
<br>good idea?
<br>Jack: If you are trying to get the most addresses, then yes, that makes sense. Try picking something a
<br>little less obvious than 10.0.0.0, but that is my preference.
<br>Honey Pots
<br>What is your opinion of honey pots? Have they become an effective deterrent?
<br>Jack: As a security person, I like to see a honey pot implemented. However, these systems usually allow
<br>too much time on their system that normally raises a flag for me. They are effective in learning new
<br>techniques of hackers, but a security team must know when to step in and pull the plug.
<br>Are honey pots having an impact in the cracker community?
<br>Jack: The more skilled hackers don't even deal with less-than-secure systems. Those hacks are the ones
<br>about whom you will never read. The less-than-skilled kiddies normally have no idea they are on a honey
<br>pot until the plug is pulled or they hear a battering ram on the door. The use of honey pots is having an
<br>impact on crackers because they are more leery, but the white hats are gaining a lot of information right
<br>now. Maybe in the future, these systems may not have the impact that they do now. But they seem to be
<br>keeping the white hats in step with the other side.
<br>How do you feel about the deployment of honey pots and IDS systems? Are they too obvious?.Jack: Honey pots and nets are a good thing if you are really interested in the research value and want to
<br>update your own IDS systems. But they do not offer enough protection to warrant investment as a means
<br>of protection. The IDS is definitely necessary and is more obvious than a honey pot.
<br>What is your take on creating a honey pot on your network? Does that attract more attention or is
<br>having only a firewall better?
<br>Jack: I like Honey Pots only for research purposes. If I notice a large increase in traffic to a specific port
<br>or range of ports, I will throw up a couple of honey pots to capture the data and analyze it. If I am not
<br>aware of a new exploit, then that research is invaluable.
<br>What is the best installation or application for a honey pot?
<br>Jack: Read the new white paper by Lance Spitzner at
<br>http://project.honeynet.org/papers/honeynet/. If you are looking at a commercial honey pot, then
<br>the Sting server from PGP is good. Otherwise, a default install of an OS and slapped onto the ‘Net is a
<br>pretty good start.
<br>VPN
<br>How do I protect the corporate network from hacks affecting my remote/VPN users?
<br>Jack: This is one of the most difficult hurdles to overcome in the security field – remote usage. Multiple
<br>tools and programs that are now on the market give security personnel more control over what a remote
<br>user can have access to, as well as provide another layer of security for the internal network. Personal
<br>firewalls, such as Network Ice's BlackICE Defender, their corporate solution ICEpac Security Suite and
<br>ZoneAlarm PRO, give you a better chance of catching certain attacks on your remote users. On another
<br>level, you can invest in Check Point’s SecureClient if you have a Check Point firewall solution, or in
<br>RedCreek Communications Ravlin Soft software solution.
<br>What tool should I use to do port scans to ensure my router and VPN installations are not left
<br>open to hackers?
<br>Jack: One of the best-known tools to use is nmap (or the Win32 ported nmapNT). This is a tool-de-jour of
<br>most script kiddies and malicious crackers. Using libnet from the Packetfactory gives you the ability to
<br>craft your own packets to test your router configuration.
<br>How secure are VPN technologies, such as Check Point's VPN-1 software suite?
<br>Jack: VPN authentications, such as Check Point, are very secure. Check Point especially utilizes Triples
<br>DES encryption. So from a mathematics perspective, the VPN knows who you are. In addition, Check
<br>Point’s secure VPN clients offer a personal firewall with policies that can be controlled via central
<br>management. This allows for the VPN to reject a non-secure connection.
<br>Can you share your tricks on accessing VPN?
<br>Jack: This all depends on the VPN itself. I don’t have any tricks on getting through to a VPN because that
<br>is a realm into which I have not delved. Looking at some of the documentation from @stake, the latest
<br>incarnation of MS-CHAP looks like some of the same procedures are used between v1 and v2. The same
<br>procedures used to derive a 24-byte response can be sniffed and a dictionary attack can be staged
<br>against them..Have you tested the Lucent LSMS? How do you think the LSMS stacks up as a firewall/VPN
<br>device?
<br>Jack: I have not yet tested this product.
<br>Public Key Infrastructure
<br>How secure is PKI?
<br>Jack: The answer is two-fold: What problem are you trying to solve, and what size implementation are
<br>you seeking? PKI as it stands is quite secure, and studies on the RSA 512 factoring conclude this. the
<br>RSA 512 has been factored, but how many people do you know that have access to more than 300
<br>computers running parallel and then feeding the matrix to a Cray? Not many. If you are trying to solve just
<br>a private e-mail issue, than you don't necessarily need a full-blown PKI solution. If you are looking for a
<br>complete implementation, than PKI is good for the company. Technology-wise, this is a secure product.
<br>As far as implementation, PKI is what you make it, and that is where the problems arise.
<br>Jack, who do you believe has a better security key solution - VeriSign or RSA's Keon solution?
<br>Jack: To me, it depends on who you want running the show, Verisign or yourself. If you don’t want to deal
<br>with the headaches of setting up a new PKI infrastructure, then go with Verisign. If you want total control
<br>of your keys, than choose Keon.
<br>Firewalls
<br>Should a company employ a firewall to prevent internal malicious users from doing damage?
<br>Jack: Internal firewalls are a good thing when you want to segment groups or address ranges. Firewalls
<br>make traversing the network without being noticed more difficult for malicious employees.
<br>From your experience, which are the best and worst firewalls?
<br>Jack: This is personal preference issue. If I tell you that I like firewall A and you like firewall B, and you
<br>think that B is better than A, and I think the opposite, what has been accomplished? You don't like A and I
<br>don't like B. This is much like the Ford v. Chevy – you like one and hate the other. For me, Firewall-1 has
<br>done a good job to this point. I like PIX as well, and I have worked with Gauntlet.
<br>Is one OS/platform better than another when it comes to firewall implementation?
<br>Jack: There is no one platform better than another. Harden the OS, remove all of the unnecessary
<br>services and make the machine a standalone. Or run an appliance firewall like Nokia, CyberGuard,
<br>SonicWALL or Cisco.
<br>In your opinion what are the best hardware firewalls on the market? Which ones are the hardest to
<br>crack?
<br>Jack: Nokia Firewalls and CyberGuard appliances seem to be the best right now. The IPSO OS on the
<br>Nokia devices are essentially hardened OpenBSD machines, which are pretty difficult to crack. The
<br>KnightStar devices are pretty difficult as well, but the main obstacle is implementation/proper
<br>configuration..What vulnerabilities are commonly exploited with MS Proxy and do you think ISA will be better?
<br>Jack: A Proxy Server or firewall is only as good security-wise as the underlying OS - that lends itself to
<br>security risk. I won't speak on Proxy Server, but with respect to ISA - too much on one machine. The
<br>refining process is going to take some maturing, just like Check Point and some of the other top security
<br>products have.
<br>What are your thoughts about firewall appliances and are they more secure than software-based
<br>firewalls?
<br>Jack: By far. Vendors have gone to a lot of trouble to harden the OS, and have removed a lot of the
<br>probable "red zones" where administrators make implementation mistakes on OS-based firewalls.
<br>Canned firewall or build your own –which is better?
<br>Jack: Canned
<br>What about Cisco PIX Firewalls?
<br>Jack_the_Hacker : Cisco PIX firewalls are Proxy-based firewalls. They do offer reasonable protection
<br>but their vulnerability is in management. If you are utilizing multiple PIX firewalls, a high probability exists
<br>that vulnerabilities will be introduced through simple mis-configurations.
<br>What software firewalls do you recommend?
<br>Jack: Check Point.
<br>When my firewall gets port scanned, I would like to know what this "offender" is actually doing.
<br>Does such software exist that gives me an idea what's outside the firewall?
<br>Jack: Check your border router logs and run a sniffer on the line. You can’t see what is going on unless
<br>something picks up the data.
<br>Given the choice of a software firewall that you install on a server or a separate hardware device
<br>that you place in front of the server, are there any advantages or disadvantages to either one?
<br>Jack: If you are talking about software versus appliance firewalls, I like both. Unless you are comfortable
<br>in hardening your server that you are going to install the firewall software on, then I suggest the
<br>appliance. If you know exactly what you want in your server, then install the software firewall. Remember,
<br>in the end, they are both the same firewall application.
<br>How secure is a network that lives behind a correctly configured Check Point Firewall?
<br>Jack: Correctly configured is a vague statement, but I would say that is safer than before. Do you
<br>remember what port you usually open up for you to host your site? 80? It’s still an open port. The fewer
<br>holes in the firewall, the less with which crackers have to work.
<br>Personal Firewalls
<br>In my opinion, the next security product is going to be the personal firewall. How secure will these
<br>be? Are users going to be lulled into a false sense of security?.Jack: I would tend to agree with you on the widespread usage of the personal firewall. A report
<br>completed fewer than 3 months ago showed a large hole in the basics of these firewalls. They are
<br>basically proxy servers. So if you can get someone to open a Trojanized program (i.e. Explore.exe), you
<br>have bypassed the security. Users will get into an automatic mode with these tools as they see the scans
<br>register.
<br>What do you think of ZoneAlarm?
<br>Jack: ZoneAlarm is a great personal firewall, but every personal firewall has one main flaw - policy
<br>management. We're not going to go into that here, but a recent case study reviewed the overall security
<br>of all personal firewalls. You can probably find that case study with a Web search.
<br>Jack, please tell me what you think. How secure are small PC [windows] networks [always on
<br>cable or DSL] that run firewall programs like ZoneAlarm or BlackICE?
<br>Jack: Having the personal firewall programs is better than nothing. They do a pretty good job at keeping
<br>out the truly amateur individuals, but nothing against some higher-level script kiddies.
<br>What would you recommend for a personal firewall for desktop users with cable or DSL
<br>connections?
<br>Jack: Of the three main personal firewalls, I like ZoneAlarm, mainly due to price. I think that BlackICE is
<br>darn good as well, and so is Norton’s solution.
<br>Hacking/Auditing
<br>How can I test my security from external attacks?
<br>Jack: Penetration testing is the main source of information that tells you whether you have done an
<br>adequate job of securing your environment. How would you do the pen. test? Black-box it. Try to have
<br>someone in the infosec team run the test without any prior knowledge of the target. Run such tools as
<br>firewall tools, port scanners and more.
<br>What are some good footprinting tools? Where can I get them?
<br>Jack: Nmap – get it at www.insecure.org. There are plenty of others, but this is the most used one and
<br>the best right now.
<br>Are smaller companies' networks less attractive to a hacker than a larger company? Or maybe
<br>more attractive because they could be more vulnerable?
<br>Jack: Attractive nonetheless. I would use that as a waypoint for more ambitious goals. Small companies
<br>make for good decoys. Most small companies want their systems to run and are not as interested in
<br>security. They will know they need security when IBM calls them and says that their logs reach back to
<br>XYZ Company attempting to break in.
<br>What is the industry standard with regard to third-party ethical hacks being accepted by clients?
<br>We are getting more clients requiring their own ethical hacks, and they are not allowing third-party
<br>hacks to be used for security assessment.
<br>Jack: There is not an industry standard at this time for third-party ethical hacks. This is more along the
<br>lines of: Do the ends justify the means? If you are in an industry where security is a paramount issue,
<br>then ethical hacks are necessary. If you are in one where security has taken a back seat, then an ethical
<br>hack may not be necessary..How do hackers stay in touch with one another today?
<br>Jack: IRC is my friend and compatriot. If you see that running on your system, you have an issue.
<br>Squash it. ICQ, and some message boards are also popular methods.
<br>What tools do you recommend for penetration testing?
<br>Jack: Tools from Foundstone are good, tools from farm9.com seem to be good. But this is more of a
<br>services function from consulting firms, such as Ernst &Young and Accenture.
<br>Where would I find a copy of nmap or nmapNT?
<br>Jack: Insecure.org and eeye.com, respectively.
<br>Are most external attacks basically random? Or are they more planned, as in a need to garner a
<br>badge of honor for some club of attackers?
<br>Jack: Mostly random and looking for the recognition, or for trying to join a crew. Look at SilverLordz,
<br>Hackweiser, and some others that have been on a tear lately. The more planned external attacks lie
<br>dormant for extended periods of time, and may or may not be the work or a true hacker, not a skiddie.
<br>If you’re a newbie infosec, besides nmap, where would you go for information on penetration
<br>testing.
<br>Jack: SANS.org is a good place for information. Get on the Pen-test listserv from Securityfocus.com and
<br>Vuln-dev list.
<br>What are your tools of choice when searching for vulnerabilities?
<br>Jack: Security Analyzer from NetIQ does a great job and comes back with a thorough list.
<br>Besides social engineering, what are your other favorite exploits? Where do you see the most
<br>problems with a security implementation, besides human error?
<br>Jack: Mis-configuration is one thing, but admins forgetting to implement patches in a timely fashion is
<br>another. How long has the NT RedButton vulnerability been out? Yet you can still find this on the Net.
<br>How about the wu-ftpd problems? Same thing – still out there. IIS has taken a lot of flak recently because
<br>of rain forest puppy’s research, but the disclosure of these holes is important to companies that want to
<br>do business on the Net. Make sure your admins keep current.
<br>Would a hacker be more inclined to go after a target because they have a broadband connection
<br>versus analog dial-up? Or are both equally at risk?
<br>Jack: Both are at risk, but having a broadband connection as a pipeline is very enticing to a cracker. If I
<br>take over a machine running 98 with a 1.5MB line attached to it, I have a great place to start most of my
<br>attacks. "Always-on" connections are easier to find than dynamically assigned addresses when dialing up
<br>to an ISP.
<br>What was site interested you when you were hacking?
<br>Jack: That depended on my mood of the day. If I wanted a challenge, hacking into a larger corporation
<br>would take a few days to a week, while just wanting to be playful prompted me to access small
<br>businesses that did secure their sites..What are some of the "clues" left behind (and during) a hack?
<br>Jack: Depending on where they got in, your router logs might be able to see the IP address showing
<br>where the traffic originated. Depending on which OS they are getting into, the tracks could be in the
<br>System logs, or the sys partition.
<br>What is Ping O’ Death?
<br>Jack: This attack causes a buffer to overflow on the target host by sending an echo request packet that is
<br>larger than the maximum IP packet size of 65535 bytes. As the target machine reconstructs the packets,
<br>the final packet is larger than the 65535 limit and causes the DoS attack. This was an old style tactic from
<br>a few years ago. Most OS’s have been patched to withstand this attack. Get more information 
<br>here:http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html
<br>What are the legal implications with hacking your company's systems to prove they are
<br>vulnerable and raise security on the to-do list?
<br>Jack: I have never hacked my company’s site unless I got prior written approval. This included legal
<br>counsel from the company. Some of the qualifications that I would ask for include: exposure of
<br>confidential information would not lead to suspension or termination (such as passwords, e-mail and
<br>instant messages) and complete shutdown of a production server due to an attack could not lead to
<br>suspension or termination.
<br>Admins receive phone calls often and are asked questions concerning the physical network, etc.
<br>of their worksites. What questions should you never answer and why?
<br>Jack: Answer as vaguely as possible. Never answer, “Who is in charge?” or “Where are you located?”
<br>Those answers just lead to narrowing down attacks. I am always paranoid about people that ask me
<br>about my network, I just answer, “It is working.”
<br>What is a teardrop attack?
<br>Jack: A teardrop attack is one in which the fragmentation of the packets is overlapping. This causes the
<br>targeted, mostly Linux, machine to incorrectly attempt to re-assemble the packets and crash. The target
<br>machine looks at the offset of the packets and re-assembles them according to the offset, but packet B’s
<br>offset states that it starts inside of A:
<br>13:23:13 hostile.com.32157 > friendly.com.53: udp 28 (frag 242:36@0+)
<br>13:23:13 hostile.com > friendly.com: (frag 242:4@24)
<br>Should I really interpret port scans as a prelude to attack?
<br>Jack: Not necessarily an attack, but definite door rattling. Once they start to pick the lock, consider it an
<br>attack. What I mean by this is once you notice that the scans burst at you for a few days in a row and
<br>then you see intermittent attempts, be ready for the attack.
<br>Are there any "Robin Hoods" in the hackers or crackers community?
<br>Jack: It depends on your definition of a “Robin Hood.” Some of the things I did before now could be
<br>considered a Robin Hood act. I helped the poor sys admins who did not quite understand security and
<br>prodded them into action.
<br>Information Sites
<br>What are your favorite sources of online information?.Jack: Bugtraq, Max Vision's Whitehats.com, SANS and GIAC. Astalavista.com also has some very good
<br>links to the underground.
<br>Are there any publications (online or otherwise) that list NT Server 4 security loopholes and fixes
<br>that you would recommend?
<br>Jack: Bugtraq archives and Windows IT Security (formerly NTSecurity.net). More monetary damage
<br>comes from inside, and most systems internally are NT/Windows.
<br>Do you recommend any sites on the Web?
<br>Jack: www.whitehats.com, Windows IT Security (formerly NTSecurity.net),
<br>www.securityfocus.com and packetstormsecurity.org are good starting sites.
<br>What books or learning materials do you consider viable to learning about taking advantage of
<br>certain weaknesses found in systems? Or are any worth investing in?
<br>Jack: Since I have been in the security field, I have had more respect for some people in particular.
<br>Stephen Northcutt is a good analyst. Bruce Schneier is a leading expert. And of course the guys over at
<br>@Stake are great. Hacking Exposed: Second Edition is pretty good. And the older Maximum Security by
<br>Anonymous is good. But the best learning materials are your peers. The security field is really a small
<br>world. The more communication you have with one another, the better you stand a chance of turning
<br>away kiddies and resisting even skilled hack attempts. SANS has become a leader in gathering some
<br>very bright minds together for analysis, and the papers that they release are good learning materials as
<br>well.
<br>What do you think of Foundstone's Hacking Class? Have you ever seen this before and what is
<br>your take?
<br>Jack: I met the Foundstone people a few months back, even if they don't remember me, and they strike
<br>me as knowing what they are doing. I would be interested in actually attending one of their Extreme
<br>Hacking classes if only to see what they do know. Their research is headed up by <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">JD Glaser</B>. He is very
<br>talented, as evidenced by his previous tools under NTObjectives.
<br>Jack, what is the best book on the market today that would be a study guide on how to be a
<br>hacker and at the same time teach you how to protect your servers from being hacked?
<br>Jack: There is no definitive guide on how to hack. There ARE guides on how to protect your system, one
<br>of which is Hacking Exposed: 2nd Edition by the guys from Foundstone. However, it's also best to
<br>subscribe to lists such as SANS, CERT and other vulnerability resources. By the time it's in a book, you're
<br>already extremely far behind.
<br>Jack, I had questions about training – how to convince a small- to mid-sized company that their
<br>network admins need security training even though they do not have as large a Web presence as
<br>companies like Microsoft.
<br>Jack: One mid-size ($50M+) company I recently worked with refused to upgrade or even consider
<br>security options. What they can't grasp is that the information they keep under lock and key (their sales
<br>contact list) could be extracted by simple social engineering, and their company could be severely
<br>damaged financially by a competitor receiving that contact list. According to recent studies, more than 3
<br>percent of unplanned outages are related to security breaches and issues. So for no other reason, you'd
<br>do this to improve availability. How much is your intellectual property actually worth?.With the exception of reading the numerous e-mails and information I receive from SANS, CERT,
<br>etc., how can I keep abreast of all the new information?
<br>Jack: Limiting yourself to a couple specific sources helps. If you've overflowed yourself with information,
<br>you probably need to cut back and remove whichever source is your "weakest link."
<br>You mentioned above that when it's in a book, you're far behind. But what about UNIX OS and
<br>some computer languages, among other things? They're still the basics, aren't they? I mean with
<br>that knowledge, you can become a hacker?
<br>Jack: That is definitely a place to start. Most individuals I know started in UNIX and learned to program
<br>from there. What we mentioned above is more along the lines that by the time the book is checked for
<br>errors and edited, the exploits have been in the wild for too long. You’re playing catch-up by then.
<br>Are you familiar with Steve Gibson's shields up site? If so, how effective an indicator of one's
<br>security is it?
<br>Jack: I am familiar with this site. This is a good site for the normal consumer to have a look at when they
<br>have an “always-on” connection to the Internet.
<br>What are the best sources of information for securing an NT/2000 network, particularly IIS?
<br>Jack: I have read parts of the Mastering Windows 2000 Server by Mark Minasi and found it to be quite
<br>good. Hacking Exposed: Second Edition has some very good points on what to secure within your
<br>environment. Checking out SecurityFocus.com always helps as well. The Microsoft team put together a
<br>very nice checklist for IIS. at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/iis5chk.asp.
<br>What are the best avenues one should follow to find the best bang for the buck, if you will, in
<br>security training? I am familiar with self-learning. But there are so many exploits out there that
<br>learning them all on your own without proper guidance is difficult.
<br>Jack: I took a track from the SANS team a while back, and I really enjoyed my time there. There is a lot of
<br>good information from the courses. The least -expensive security training is getting on message boards
<br>and asking a lot of questions. There are thousands of people out there that want to pass on their
<br>knowledge on security. Some of the self-learning that you can do is put up a honey pot and watch it get
<br>taken over. Make sure that you are able to see what happens on it before you deploy it, and learn from
<br>those actions.
<br>What would be a good book to read that shows an administrator more understanding of how to
<br>secure Linux?
<br>Jack: Try the Real World Linux Security : Intrusion Prevention, Detection and Recovery by Bob Toxen.
<br>How does one subscribe to CERT and the other good subscription lists to stay up to date on
<br>security?
<br>Jack: SecurityFocus has instructions on its site (SecurityFocus.com) as to how to subscribe to their
<br>multiple mailing lists. CERT is the same way. Check out the sites from which you want to receive mail,
<br>and they should have instructions on how to subscribe.
<br>What is a good "Security 101" book for the complete novice?
<br>Jack: The Hacking Exposed books are pretty good. But to be honest, there are no “Security 101” books.
<br>Security is such an all-encompassing problem that no single book could tell you everything you need to
<br>know, even for the complete novice..How do you feel about Lance Spitzners’ white papers?
<br>Jack: Lance’s papers definitely hold a lot a value from which individuals can learn. The motives paper
<br>shows actual logs of what the script kiddies do once they have access. Lance and the Honeynet (Project)
<br>crew know their stuff.
<br>Lack of security knowledge by admins: What are some tips you can give to lock down each of
<br>these OS’s?
<br>Jack: The quickest way would be to go to SecurityFocus and check out each section of their site
<br>(SecurityFocus.com). The Microsoft section has checklists on securing IIS, NT 4.0, 2000. The Linux
<br>section has the same layout and information.
<br>Do you have any suggestions for security training?
<br>Jack: Try the GIAC courses offered by SANS, as well as looking into the studies for CISSP certification.
<br>Tools
<br>Are DoS and DDoS attacks going to (continue to) be a threat?
<br>Jack: These attacks are definitely going to be a threat. DoS attacks are easy enough to initiate upon a
<br>vulnerable system, but almost every system is vulnerable to DDoS attacks. It is the same adage that
<br>shows if they have a larger pipeline to use than you do, the DDoS will more than likely work. However, if
<br>you are able to subscribe to some online tracking listservs, such as Bugtraq, you should be able to keep
<br>up with some of the openings and how other security individuals are trying to combat them. The security
<br>field is like a large fraternity or sorority, everyone knows the same names, and everyone looks for help
<br>when a disaster strikes.
<br>Are any tools available that don't require two full-time people to monitor the alerts and track them
<br>down?
<br>Jack: This is dependent on both the size of your environment, as well as your initial assessment on what
<br>is going to be monitored. Most organizations should have at least two individuals on staff that track and/or
<br>monitor the alerts that come in. Should they be full time? Not necessarily. Most current tools may be
<br>distributed among numerous monitoring stations. At least one individual should look at these alerts almost
<br>full time. The reason it should not be full time is the human element. If one were to look at the same logs
<br>for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, it becomes "noise" to them. That is where the backup comes into play.
<br>When the saturated person becomes overwhelmed, the backup person should be able to take a fresh
<br>look at the information. Even when talking to other Intrusion Detection analysts, they will tell you the same
<br>thing. That is why a community of these analysts help you through your detects.
<br>Are there any tools/utilities that you would say are essential?
<br>Jack: There are multiple tools that are essential in order to have a well-rounded security solution. First
<br>would be log consolidation tools. One of the key sources for forensic analysis are the logs. If they are not
<br>secured, any information gleaned is suspect at best. Next is an IDS tool. VA tools and automated
<br>response actions are also required. A firewall is very essential.
<br>How do you see integration between auditing activity (audit logs consolidation), monitoring
<br>activity (Host network-based IDS) and vulnerability assessment activity (host-network)?
<br>Jack: This would be considered the complete package as far as security. Security cannot be looked upon
<br>as a one-size-fits-all type of solution. You cannot rely only on your firewalls, your network-based intrusion.systems and your auditing capabilities separately. Security has to encompass all viable points of entry,
<br>and even some you don't see. These are the reasons why you need to look into implementing a security
<br>policy using those host- and network-based scanning tools before an attacker or internal employee does
<br>attacks your system. You must be able to look through logs from your firewalls, your border and internal
<br>routers and your network-based intrusion tools and host-based tools. Lastly, you would have to look
<br>through your host audit logs, whether they be *NIX of Windows.
<br>Have you seen any conversations regarding the value (or lack) of biometrics solutions?
<br>Jack: Biometrics was a necessary security tool on one of my previous contracts, but that lays within the
<br>physical security aspect of things. The controller for the biometrics is the target at that point. Again, it
<br>depends on what you are trying to secure – physical access to your most critical servers or your users’
<br>access to the network.
<br>How important is it to stay on top of vulnerability fixes on my publicly accessible servers?
<br>Jack: IT is VERY IMPORTANT to keep up to date with these fixes. Countless examples are Attrition.org
<br>that show how admins who don't keep up with patches ride into the sunset in infamy.
<br>What is the most exciting security technology that you see today?
<br>Jack: I am interested in seeing if the Rabin crypto stands up to the analysis of Mr. Schneier and others in
<br>the crypto field. Another lets you implement a single point of log consolidation from numerous points –
<br>audit logs, firewall logs, IDS logs and host-based logs. Now, if you can come up with something like that,
<br>the development would be exciting because it takes many of the unseen problems and makes them
<br>visible.
<br>What is your opinion on the effectiveness of IDS?
<br>Jack: Network or host-based? Network has problems when used in switched networks. Network IDS is
<br>possible, but much harder to implement. Host-based, when used alone, is only one facet of the overall
<br>security of your environment. IDS alone will not save you. But an overall security scheme of, say,
<br>restricted border router, firewall A, load balancer, NIDS sensor in DMZ, firewall B, internal switched
<br>network, internal NIDS sensors and then host-based IDS is great. If you can make that work in your
<br>environment, you would be about 90-percent complete. Vulnerability testing and adherence to security
<br>policy will make up most of the rest.
<br>Should hackers who release proggies like VBS Worm Generator be held responsible, like the
<br>person who goes and gets the proggie and releases the worm to the Net?
<br>Jack: IMHO yes.
<br>We've been looking into some intrusion detection tools, but most don't seem to be worth the time
<br>or money. Have you had any success with these types of tools?
<br>Jack: Traditional IDS is like reading in the newspaper that you've died in a car accident the day after it
<br>happened. You want to establish a security solution that takes data from IDS tools, but can then be
<br>adaptive and automatically respond. Remember that exposure time equals detection time plus reaction
<br>time. If your IDS does not provide immediately reaction time, then you are still behind the hacker.
<br>What do you think of the latest program from Rain Forest Puppy that renders IDS essentially
<br>useless?.Jack: I am trying to find the program you are talking about, but the one that does come to mind is from 
<br>K2called ADMutate. That API is dangerous. We knew that this would come along someday, and that is why
<br>most IDS systems fail – the system is based on recognizing signatures, not out of band processes. RFP
<br>released RFProxy, which is something that we are currently evaluating.
<br>What about SAINT?
<br>Jack: SAINT is a good tool that has been around for a while. It definitely does a good job.
<br>Would a Web server running VMS on an Alpha be less vulnerable to hacking?
<br>Jack: I don’t know since I have never come across that combination. That would almost lead into 
<br>the“defense-by-obscurity” realm.
<br>How do you perceive the use of polymorphic code such as ADMutate? Good or evil?
<br>Jack: Both. Good, so that one can try and duplicate the morphing of a new exploit before it happens, and
<br>bad because of the intentions behind it.
<br>Do you recommend a Unix-based OS for an intrusion detection box? Or is NT/2000 sufficient?
<br>Jack: NT is sufficient, but anything straight out of the box is not secure. Look at the skill set of your team:
<br>Do you have more *NIX people than NT? Vice versa? Go with what works for your team. *NIX can be
<br>highly tuned, and so can NT.
<br>What are your thoughts on the newest wireless network problems?
<br>Jack: This was bound to happen sooner or later. More people want the really interesting equipment in
<br>their offices. The problems with WEP are basic implementation, which in turn, shows the problems with
<br>the algorithms used for WEP. As is documented at http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/isaac/wep-faq.html,
<br>current implementations use a single key that is shared between all mobile stations and access points.
<br>Sharing a single key, along with the low strength of the initialization vector, makes cracking an 
<br>encryptedtransmission possible. I believe that more vendors will be looking to strengthen this technology.
<br>What happened with PitBull in Europe?
<br>Jack: What happened is that they went up against a true set of hackers, ones that know an OS and don't
<br>use blatant DoS attacks. The fact that the hack was known in the underground for some time also shows
<br>that securing the OS is one of the most important steps in securing your infrastructure. What LSD did was
<br>hack Solaris for x86, but the PitBull software was not hacked. But who cares? They won because they
<br>knew what they were doing. Period. End of story.
<br>*NIX
<br>In your opinion, is an open source OS, such as Linux, as secure as a proprietary flavor of Unix (for
<br>instance, AIX or Solaris)?
<br>Jack: No version is secure out of the box. Read the reports that show that old patches that were not
<br>implemented on an OpenBSD box were exploited by a hacker, or put any *NIX flavor in the place of
<br>OpenBSD. Most Proprietary *NIX flavors improve performance, not necessarily security.
<br>How secure is Linux?.Jack: I think that a Linux box is as secure as you make it. Every default install is not good, whether it be
<br>NT or Linux. The open source community does a very good job of keeping everyone informed of new
<br>patches and holes that are found.
<br>What would you consider the easiest targets for attack – NT/2K or Linux?
<br>Jack: Linux by far. The majority of the people administrating Linux systems have almost no clue of how to
<br>secure or even MINIMIZE risk. Second would be NT4, and then 2000. All three are considered easy to
<br>implement OS's, but fall victim to bad practices. Again, I can't stress how important good implementation
<br>is.
<br>NT / 2000
<br>Jack, do you have some tips on securing NT?
<br>Jack: SANS top 10 list for securing NT is a good starting ground. I saw a script yesterday that looked
<br>really good as well, but I don't have the reference right now. There is one thing that I would like to say on
<br>that issue though – what do want that server or workstation to do? That is what determines the level to
<br>which you harden a box.
<br>For you, Win2K is more secure than NT? How much?
<br>Jack: I think over the past year, with security measures that were put into 2000 show, that a true 
<br>2000implementation is a pretty sound solution. There is that backwards compatibility issue with NT, but I think
<br>that Microsoft has done a good job with 2000. You can't put an index on the amount security has
<br>improved in 2000, but Microsoft learned some lessons from 4.0 and tried to improve them in 2000.
<br>Is NTLMv2 much more secure than NTLM? What is the difference between the two?
<br>Jack: While initially it was believed that NTLM v2 was more secure, conversations with Microsoft by an
<br>individual who recently submitted his findings to NTBugtraq may suggest otherwise.
<br>What is the best way to secure a Win2K Server?
<br>Jack: There are checklists that the Win2K team has put together. If I had the URL handy I would post it -
<br>this is one of those subjects that could spawn a chat in and of itself.
<br>What is the best way to lock down a Win2000 Domain?
<br>Jack: Remove your network cable. There is no "one thing" that I can cover in the context of this chat. I
<br>highly recommend getting a Windows 2000 book, such as Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows 2000 Server
<br>book. Microsoft press also has several books that cover this.
<br>You are stating that Windows NT is easier to hack than 2000? Why?
<br>Jack: NT has been around longer and more people know about the vulnerabilities in the system.
<br>Windows 2000 has not been around long enough to have a massive explosion of vulnerabilities, even
<br>though it has its fair share of them. If you have a completely 2000 infrastructure, getting into that system
<br>is harder than using old tried and true tricks for an NT system. The usage of AD and Kerberos help quite
<br>a bit.
<br>What are your thoughts about securing Windows 2000 Active Directory?.Jack: If you are asking me on ways to secure Active Directory, I know some ways to help it out. First
<br>thing, make sure that only one or two individuals get the Enterprise Administrator’s role, and no one gets
<br>Schema Admin. Second, think about how you are going to setup the AD well ahead of implementation.
<br>Understand Active Directory as well as you can.
<br>If Linux machines are easier to hack, why are so many NT servers broken into?
<br>Jack: Most of the Linux machines that are used in the consumer area do not get security updates as
<br>frequently as Windows machines. Businesses that use Linux must stay on top of package updates,
<br>especially security-related updates, and they can’t always do so. That is why it may be easier to hack
<br>than an NT machine. However, most businesses run NT servers.
<br>How secure is terminal server in a Win2K native domain?
<br>Jack_the_Hacker : It is pretty good. We are still doing some research on this topic as it has become
<br>more prevalent for us to deal with. If you do a search on Securityfocus.com, you will notice that there are
<br>not a lot of issues with Terminal Server for Win2K.
<br>What is your opinion on Windows 2000, specifically IPsec, Kerberos and NAT?
<br>Jack: Always have liked IPsec, and I especially like how Win2K has implemented it. The Kerberos is
<br>definitely a step above using NTLM hashes, and NAT has been around and is quite common.
<br>What do you see as being some of the biggest problems with Windows 2000?
<br>Jack: The three I's - Implementation, Implementation and Implementation. In the OS itself, the worst
<br>problem now is reverse-compatibility with insecure network protocols. For example, NT4 SMB.
<br>Misc.
<br>We all know that network security is a vital role in all major organizations. Why then is the world
<br>waking up so late to it and why is the IT industry not creating hype to promote a "security-conscious"
<br>world?
<br>Jack: There is no real need for the IT industry to hype security than it has to this point. Companies that
<br>do not understand what security is do not invest their resources into anything more than performance
<br>over security. These companies will not understand their risks until they have a wake-up call from
<br>(hopefully) an internal source rather than an external attack. The IT industry hyped e-commerce during its
<br>explosion because getting hard-working individuals to submit their credit card information to a Web page,
<br>rather than a person who they would see slide it through a reader, was difficult. They wanted to show
<br>peace of mind with security for B2C and P2P businesses. As that boom has started a small downturn,
<br>more individuals have started to take that information and try to translate it to security within the
<br>workplace. Most individuals have misconceptions of hackers, crackers, phreakers and script kiddies or
<br>their stereotypical ideas of based on media persona. The FBI will tell you that crackers do not fall into 
<br>astereotypical person. The attack could be from a 12-year-old girl to a 53-year-old system admin.
<br>What is your opinion on full disclosure of vulnerabilities?
<br>Jack: This is a question that is loaded and ready to go off. For me, I like to let the system vendor know
<br>what I found, give them a few days, then let Bugtraq know. I believe in full disclosure for certain problems.
<br>Others, I leave with the vendor. If it is a large hole like the BIND bug, full disclosure was good and 
<br>bad.Disclosure of a small vulnerability in Netscape's browser that allows them to take over a non-secure
<br>session, I leave with Netscape..How long have you been doing security?
<br>Jack: Security on the good side, five years. On the other side, around seven years.
<br>Aren't you concerned that speaking in an open event like this could also bolster any crackers
<br>looking to get resources for tools and information?
<br>Jack: I opened myself up for this event. More than likely, some outside entities will look for the
<br>information for which IT managers are looking. I wouldn't say being scared, I say wanting to inform
<br>outside individuals.
<br>What is your programming language background and platforms?
<br>Jack: Some old-school Assembly, C & C++, some VBScript and Perl. My main platforms are OpenBSD,
<br>Windows and Solaris.
<br>How do you feel about security certification? (CISSP, SANS certs, etc)
<br>Jack: I like the CISSP certification because of the broad range it covers. The GIAC cert is pretty good
<br>because of the level of testing that they use. Certifications in previous products and years were
<br>considered "paper certs" because you didn't need a lot of real world experience. I think that SANS and
<br>ISC² figured that out and wanted their certifications to mean something. I would much rather trust a
<br>CISSP with designing and implementing a security policy for my company than a strict auditor.
<br>What is your background? Did you start in networking and work into security, or was your start in
<br>programming? Which do you see as being more beneficial?
<br>Jack: I first started out as a bona-fide user. My first real start was in networking and some BASIC
<br>programming at the same time. I stuck with the networking aspect and kept up with the programming
<br>side. With security, you can't have one without the other. If you do, you are just an admin resetting
<br>passwords.
<br>Haven't the recent prosecution of hackers discouraged would be hackers?
<br>Jack: I don't think they have been discouraged. They seem to be more determined in certain cases.
<br>Hackweiser is on a rampage right now. And until he/she is prosecuted, the defacements will continue.
<br>Back a few years ago, you had a few good crews put together. Nowadays, you have a lot of average to
<br>good crews who are looking for props from their peers and then they want recognition from the security
<br>field as well. After the first few successive hacks, it is a power game. And everyone thinks they are
<br>invincible.
<br>Is it easy to crack a computer running Gnutella, Napster and other similar file-sharing apps?
<br>Jack: I have not delved into the realm as of yet. I cannot give you an educated answer to this question. I
<br>can do some more research to let you know in the future.
<br>Do you see a career model from the underground into the enterprise employment or consulting as
<br>current options that would create more interest in hostile security "cracking?"
<br>Jack: It is evident in some of the defacements out there, but those are kiddies that want to break into the
<br>security field and get paid for what they know about their scripts..What reformed Jack?
<br>Jack: Realizing that there was more to life than having to watch my back for badges every day. Plus,
<br>when I had FBI agents show up at door one morning for something completely different. Those badges
<br>look scary.
<br>What would be the best method to discourage would be hackers from starting in the first place?
<br>Jack: I don't know. The media glorifies the attention these hackers like.
<br>Who/what influenced you to change sides AND how did you sell yourself as
<br>trustworthy/employable, given extents of background checks, etc.?
<br>Jack: There was this one network admin that I met at one of my first real jobs that showed me the ropes
<br>on how to work in the real world. I don't remember his name, but I figured that I didn't have to stare at a
<br>CRT in my room the rest of my life. Actually, some of the companies did not do background checks on
<br>me. And I don't have a rap sheet. I was forthcoming with them when asked about my experience with the
<br>"other side." But those actions were done when I was young and naïve. Now, I am just young.
<br>What keys should one look for in a log to spot an intrusion?
<br>Jack: When your audit logs are gone. It depends on the method. Slow-and-low is hard to see. A straight
<br>hack-attack is pretty blatant. Take a look at the Honeynet Project's logs, as well as some of the papers
<br>from SANS.
<br>In your opinion what needs to be done to prevent people from hacking (i.e. tougher laws, better
<br>prosecution, etc.)?
<br>Jack: All of the above. The old adage that the world is a small place rings even more true with the
<br>Internet. You can't tell if the hack was from your neighbor across the street or in some other foreign
<br>country. I think more crackdowns are going to happen across the globe, and that might stop a few of the
<br>hacks. But this will never stop. Tougher extradition laws would be a start, but I am not going into law here.
<br>What do you get out of hacking?
<br>Jack: Different people get different things from hacking. Those driven by money often find a very lucrative
<br>source of income (ask those stung by the FBI). Others do it for the game, sort of like rich kleptomaniacs.
<br>They don't need to steal but enjoy the rush. Some try to believe the "noble ends justifies barbaric means,"
<br>so they are doing sys admins a favor. I tend to lean toward the thrill of the game – can I do it?
<br>What is your definition of a hacker and how do you know when he/she has been reformed?
<br>Jack: Hackers work on the foundational premise of freedom of information. Crackers work on the
<br>foundational premise of infliction of harm. Determining whether or not someone is reformed is very
<br>difficult. Who's to say an alcoholic doesn't sneak a drink now and then?
<br>How can one be reformed? Do you ever get the itch?
<br>Jack: Check out the efforts of the 2600 crew. The itch is always there for curiosity, but I no longer get the
<br>urge to crack systems without proper approval (or funding).
<br>What happened with the Microsoft Premier Support hiccup?.Jack: This is a prime example of what everyone in the security field should know: A computer is
<br>administered by a human and configured by a human - it's bound to go wrong somehow. The processes
<br>were not completely followed and a mis-configuration occurred, opening up a hole. This is the No. 1
<br>problem with all infrastructures – the technology is good, but the implementation may not be right.
<br>Has the perceived economic slowdown affected the security market? If so, how?
<br>Jack: In some ways, the slowdown has. Most of the high-tech marketplace is feeling the pinch of the
<br>slowdown. But so-called "old" money firms, such as the oil and gas industry, are booming. There are
<br>more laid-off employees who may have damaging information, and some know how to get back into their
<br>ex-employers systems. If there is a time for more security, now is that time.
<br>What is the HIPAA initiative looking like?
<br>Jack: With a 2003 deadline, more providers are finding out that this is larger than once thought. As
<br>evidenced last year when someone accessed a Washington State hospital’s patient information, hacking
<br>the system wasn't too difficult. This is a very large undertaking, and those providers who have not yet
<br>started on the path to compliance are going to have a problem to finish before the deadline. The main
<br>problem is the ever-changing face of security. Several years ago, it was physical, then it turned to anti-viral,
<br>now it's PKI and intrusion-detection systems. Are those providers ready for it? Probably not.
<br>Is network security compromised with the use of IM's?
<br>Jack: This has not been widely studied, but initial studies indicate that yes, this is the case.
<br>With all the talk of Chinese hackers these days, how susceptible is our nation’s infrastructure to
<br>cyber-terrorism?
<br>Jack: Various areas and companies are obviously going to be better-protected than others. A better
<br>source of information might be the NSA or other government agencies.
<br>What do you consider the hardest OS to hack into?
<br>Jack: IPSO - the OS that runs on the Nokia Firewall Appliances. OpenBSD is a close second. However,
<br>this doesn't take into consideration poor systems administration. Bad implementation will open big holes
<br>in your network regardless of how strong your NOS is.
<br>How do you recommend that admins react to Web site penetration attempts? Offensively or
<br>defensively? Any specific offensive tools that you recommend?
<br>Jack: I would recommend acting defensively. Reacting with an offensive state of mind is much easier
<br>when your territory is being invaded. Collect all of the data you can from the attack, seal it away and call
<br>your law enforcement officials. Make sure that they are able to do forensic analysis on the data, and have
<br>them prosecute the crew or individual. Taking matters into your own hands could be bad. What happens if
<br>the IP address that you are killing is actually another company that has been hacked? Do you want to add
<br>to that sysadmin’s headache already?
<br>What is your best advice for someone who has been fired from a network admin job for allegedly
<br>"hacking"? Do any good law firms support "the hacker"?
<br>Jack: I can’t answer that question very well because I have not gone to that extent with my activities. The
<br>Stanford Law School is attempting to defend the 2600 crew in the DeCSS trial..How do VMS/OpenVMS rate in terms of 'hardness'?
<br>Jack: I haven’t used VMS in a while. But do a search on packetstormsecurity.org for VMS. See how
<br>many vulnerabilities exist.
<br>How do you convince a company that security needs to be a prime concern and to take action?
<br>Jack: Convincing the company’s upper management that they need security is still difficult because they
<br>see the bottom line and ask why they are spending so much on security when they haven’t had an attack.
<br>My response is, “You haven’t had an attack that you can see because of your current architecture.” I will
<br>then hand them their passwords, selected e-mails that they have sent out among one another, their
<br>current driver’s license information and Social Security Number that was sniffed off a Web site. That
<br>usually gets their attention. This is the normal scare tactic that security analysts are left with. This is not
<br>the best way, just the easiest.
<br>As a professional hacker, would you want, or think it beneficial, to be a dedicated security
<br>specialist or be a jack of all trades? (No pun intended)
<br>Jack: To become a dedicated security specialist, you have to be a jack-of-all-trades. Look at the CISSP
<br>requirements. Security does not have just one facet. It is quite multi-faceted.
<br>Do you find that firms, in particular industries, are attacked more frequently than others? If so,
<br>which do you find are mainly targeted? (e.g. real estate, political, etc)
<br>Jack: “Hacktivism” targets mostly government sites to spread literature on human rights that the cracker
<br>feels are being violated. From my experience, just about anyone is a target, not just the high-profile
<br>hacks.
<br>Would you enter your own personal credit card number online with today's current security
<br>practices?
<br>Jack: Yes, but only after I have done some research on them.
<br>What are your thoughts on computer forensics, in terms of the job market?
<br>Jack: I think that the demand is much greater than the supply of qualified forensic analysts. With as many
<br>hacks that occur on a daily basis, an analyst could have four months of data to sift through.
<br>Do you think the whole e-commerce will eventually melt down? Anything can be hacked into
<br>eventually? Will businesses just stop doing business on the open ’Net?
<br>Jack: In my opinion, the e-commerce world will not melt down. It has become too entrenched in today’s
<br>marketplace that consumers and businesses cringe at the thought of no e-tailers and e-business.
<br>How old were you when you started learning to Hack?
<br>Jack: I started around the age of 15.
<br>I understand that ICQ is one of the biggest security risk. Is this true?
<br>Jack: I don’t think that it is the biggest threat, but it certainly does open up holes that are not necessary.
<br>There are multiple ways to have a person open up a Trojan (horse) received through ICQ, and the overall
<br>security of ICQ is not that great.
<br>What are some of the things that a small company should avoid doing, so they don’t become
<br>"interesting" to the crackers?.Jack: Understand that everyone is a target, but for varying reasons. Hardening your Web servers will
<br>keep your site from being defaced. But make sure that your databases are more secure. Following that
<br>mantra will thwart most of the attacks that your site will come up against. Don’t keep casual contact
<br>information on the Web site. That casual contact information makes figuring out your naming convention
<br>easier for me. As much as you would like your investors to see who is in charge of running the business,
<br>it makes my life easier.
<br>What did you find to be the hardest obstacle to overcome?
<br>Jack: Old school mentality. How can a person of my age be able to do the things that I say I can? Plus,
<br>human nature shows that if you don’t understand something or someone, you tend to disregard them or
<br>try to keep away.
<br>With the Feds starting to come down hard on hackers and crackers, do groups still recruit new
<br>memberships to train and compete against other groups? Or has the entire scene gone
<br>underground?
<br>Jack: There has never been a large movement to go out and recruit people to create a crew to squash
<br>another crew. Crews get together because they want to. There are no fliers out there saying, “Come join
<br>us!” But there are lots of solicitations by people wanting to join a crew.
<br>Is there a common mistake most people tend to make when it comes to securing from an outside
<br>vulnerability?
<br>Jack: Believing that they have secured everything. The worst thing that you can do with security is
<br>become relaxed.
<br>Is it me, or is Microsoft heavily under fire? Or shouldn't I trust Microsoft's platform as a secure
<br>environment?
<br>Jack: The market leader is always going to be under fire because we trust them to produce the best
<br>products. I think that they have always tried to keep up with security issues, but the consumer wants
<br>everything. That consumer can be the home user or the corporate user - it doesn’t matter. You want to be
<br>able to browse graphic sites and not have a problem with it. Remember when it was a text-only BBS?
<br>That was before we the consumer who wanted his/her e-mail to work directly with their word processor or
<br>spreadsheet program. That was before HTML pages knew what 1.0 looked like. I like Microsoft’s
<br>platforms, but I don’t personally trust any operating system out of the box.
<br>Let's say a company you work for has NO security policy. Should you feel it is your responsibility
<br>to implement security measures of your own? Or should you insist that the directive comes from
<br>higher management?
<br>Jack: I would like to be able to do this myself but the directive must come from upper management.
<br>How do you think crackers today are responding to all the media around their activities?
<br>Jack: Pumping up their already inflated egos
