Would you like to use the Windows Update feature without being forced to register with Microsoft? OK then, this is what you can do:

Launch good ol' Regedit.
Go down to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion.
Look for a value named RegDone. If it isn't there create a new value with that name.
Right click the new value and choose Modify. Make the value 1.
Close Regedit and
Enjoy!
