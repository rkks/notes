Let's face it, finding the right device driver can be a tedious, time consuming, often impossible task! The Driver Guide was created to make finding driver updates a whole lot easier. With the help of thousands of our members, we have compiled a massive database archive of drivers and resources that is by far the largest and most comprehensive on the Web. Here is what The Driver Guide will do for you:

* Provides an easy step-by-step process for finding and installing drivers.
* Offers a huge searchable archive of over 100,000 driver files, manufacturer information, and links.
* Includes discussion boards that give members the opportunity to interact with others with their hardware type, and learn from their experiences (very useful!).
* Offers a drivers found area where members can upload new and hard to find drivers for others to download.
* Provides a driver request board where members can make requests for specific drivers.
* Includes resources for Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux, and other platforms.
* Provides links to helpful tutorials, valuable utilities, and other resources.
* Offers a great collection of old, out of date, and hard to find drivers.
* Membership is absolutely FREE! Members are given lifetime access to this site.
* Since opening in 1997, millions of people have joined The Driver Guide!
