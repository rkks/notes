How to set up a server with Apache , PHP , MySQL , Perl , phpMyAdmin

=====

Let's start by installing apache (http server) . you can download the
apache installer on www.apache.org . download the verion you like ,
even thought , in win systems i recomand verion 2 (this tutorials is
for apache 2) . here is a link for it :

Code:
http://apache.mirror.nedlinux.nl/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.52-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi


for a faster mirror , visit http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi .

After downloading the file (.msi installer) , run it . The installation wizard
is a next , next , finish 'work' ... The installer will ask you some details like
your server name , your server adress and the admin's mail adress . if
you have a domain name or a hostname , enter the info's like this :

Code:
Server Name : your_domain.org

Server Adress : www.your-domain.org

Admin Email : admin@yourdomain.org


if you don't have one , you should get on e free at :

Code:
http://www.no-ip.org/


Check the 'Run as a service for all users on port 8080' option and click
next , finish to fiinish the instllation . Advice : Install it in c: (he creates
a folder for it , don't worry) to make sure you configure it easyer .
If you are finished , open up a browser and write in the adress bar :

Code:
http://localhost/


If you will see a 'Test Page for Apache Installation' , everything works .

=====

Let's install PHP . download the archives from www.php.net . Here is a
direct link for verion 4.3.9 :

Code:
http://nl.php.net/get/php-4.3.9-Win32.zip/from/this/mirror


Make sure you download the archive and not the installer . Ok! after
downloading it , extract the archive in c:/php (this is to simplify paths) .
Now , open up c:/apache/conf/httpd.conf and search for this line :

Code:
#LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so


under that line , add this :

Code:
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

LoadModule php4_module "c:/php/sapi/php4apache2.dll"
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php4


Now search for this line :

Code:
<Directory "C:/Apache2/htdocs">


Change :

Code:
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

#
# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
#   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
#
    AllowOverride None


into :

Code:
Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI

#
# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
#   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
#
    AllowOverride All


This will allow .htaccess support on your server and make sure you can
see the content of a folder without getting a 403 forbidden error .

Now search for :

Code:
DirectoryIndex index.html index.var.html


and change it into :

Code:
DirectoryIndex index.html index.php


Save the file and restart apache . (you can restart it by pressing the
Restart apache server shortcut in the start menu or by writing :

Code:
net apache restart


in a command prompt window . Ok!

you have php working for your server icon_wink.gif . Now let's configure php and
make sure it really works ! Open up c:/php/php.ini (php.ini-dist renamed)
and search for this paragraph :

Code:
max_execution_time = 60    ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_input_time = 60   ; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
memory_limit = 5M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)


you should change this to whatever you want . here is an option i use :

Code:
max_execution_time = 300    ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_input_time = 300   ; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
memory_limit = 5M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)


Now search for :

Code:
register_globals = Off


and change it into :

Code:
register_globals = On


Search for :

Code:
extension_dir = ".\"


and change it into :

Code:
extension_dir = "c:/php/extensions"


assuming you have installed php in c: ...

Search for :

Code:
;Windows Extensions
;Note that MySQL and ODBC support is now built in, so no dll is needed for it.


and uncomment (delete the ; in the front) the following modules :

Code:
extension=php_bz2.dll
extension=php_db.dll
extension=php_gd2.dll
extension=php_java.dll
extension=php_msql.dll
extension=php_pdf.dll
extension=php_pgsql.dll
extension=php_sockets.dll


Ok! now let's change the smtp settings (this is good icon_smile.gif for you mail()
function . you need this !!!) Search for :

Code:
[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP =
smtp_port = 25

; For Win32 only.
;sendmail_from =


and change to :

Code:
[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP = mail.isp.org
smtp_port = 25

; For Win32 only.
sendmail_from = mail@your_domain.org

if you don't have a mail server or :

Code:
[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP = localhost
smtp_port = 25

; For Win32 only.
sendmail_from = mail@your_domain.org

if you have a mail server ...

Save the files . Now let's finalize the php installation . copy all the dll's
from c:/php/dlls into c:/windows/system32 . copy c:/php/php4ts.dll into
c:/windows/system32/ and copy php.ini from your folder php into
windows and system32 folder . restart apache . open up notepad and
add this into the file :

Code:
<?php
   phpinfo();
?>


save this file in your htdocs folder (c:/apache/htdocs) as info.php and
open up a browser . in the adress bar write :

Code:
http://localhost/info.php


you should see php's configuration in a table . a looong file icon_smile.gif
you can optionaly install zend optimizer . i am using it ... it doesn't
needs a tutorial . to install the PEAR modules for php , just run the
go-pear batch from the php folder and 2click the reg file to finish the
instllation .

let's install mysql . download mysql from http://www.mysql.com/ .
this tutorial applyes to verion 4.0.* ... i don't recomand using mysql
4.1 . here is a direct link :

Code:
http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-4.0/mysql-4.0.22-win.zip/from/http://mysql.proserve.nl/


after downloading , extract the arhive somewhere and run the setup.exe .
install mysql in c:/mysql and complete the installation . open up command
prompt and write this :

Code:
cd mysql
cd bin
mysqld-max-nt --install


this will install mysql as a service . recomended . now you would probably
consider downloading mysql control center . a gui tool to administrate the
server in a graphical mode . here is a link :

Code:
http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLCC/mysqlcc-0.9.4-win32.zip/from/http://mysql.proserve.nl/


install it like any other program and run the shortcut in the desktop . a
window will pop-up . it will ask you to add a new connection . here are the
info's you need to fill in :

Code:
name : localhost or main or whatever :)
host : localhost
user : root
pass :


click add , expand the databases menu and delete databse text . now
expand the users menu and delete all users except root@localhost . right
click it and select edit user . change it's password to whatever you want icon_smile.gif
now right click the server and select edit . change the password to the
pass you chosed for user root . as easy as that . mysql is installed !

phpMyADmin . you can download it from http://www.phpmyadmin.net/ .
i recommend using verion 2.5.1 pl1 . the last verion is still bugy icon_smile.gif
download , unzip the contecnt into a folder in htdocs (phpMyAdmin) and
open up config.inc.php with a text editor .

search for :

Code:
$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = '';


change it to your phpmyadmin url . eg. :

Code:
$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = http://www.your_domain.org/phpMyAdmin/';


now search for :

Code:
$cfg['blowfish_secret'] = '';


and change it to your mysql root password like this :

Code:
$cfg['blowfish_secret'] = 'password';


now search for :

Code:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'config';


and change it to :

Code:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'cookie';


save and exit . that's it ! phpMyAdmin works icon_wink.gif
