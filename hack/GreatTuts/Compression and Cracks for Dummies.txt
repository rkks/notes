If you have read thisdocument reguarding Compression and Cracks and are have some problemswith some of the CD-Rom Rips proceed to the Authers notes #2 on page 16.**NOTE*****NOTE******NOTE*****NOTE*****NOTE*****NOTE*****NOTE*****NOTE**                        January 23 1994      The following is a comprised collection of the many problems and solutions when working with .Zip and .Arj file compression and cracks.     First you should understand that most software comes on floppy disks stored as many files and subdirectories on each disk. Now days most of thesoftware is compressed on the floppies so the software manufactures don't haveto buy so many disks. There install programs usually uncompress the files asthere installed onto the hard disk. Therefore very few programs these days canbe file copied to a hard disk directory and expect the program to run. Therefore about the only reason we use programs like Pkzip and Arj is so that we can create one simple file per disk. This is the only way we can effectively work with these programs when Uploading and Downloading from the Bulletin boards.     The following is a detailed explanation of the process that takes placefrom the time a cracking group buys the originals and you type the command toplay the game on your hard drive. All examples given will be using a IBM orcompatible computer running MsDos Version 6.0.  If you don't have Dos 6.0or higher installed in your computer then get with it.      Before we start make sure you have MsDos version 6.0 or higherinstalled and that you have the following files in your C:\Dos Directory.Pkzip.exe   Version 2.04 or higherPkunzip.exe Version 2.04 or higherArj.exe     Version 2.41 or Higher     Also note that your C:\dos directory must be in your Path statement inyour autoexec.bat file. This is done so that from any dos prompt you can typePkzip, Pkunzip or Arj and that program will load. You see for example If youare in the C:\downloads Directory and you issue the Pkunzip command, Doslooks first in the current directory which is C:\downloads for the Pkzip.exe file and does not find it . It then looks every where your Path statement says tolook and finds it in your C:\dos directory and loads it.OK so the originals for the game SpaceX just arrived and the program consistsof four 1.44 kb floppy disks. A quick look at the disks shows that the diskscontain disk Labels as follows.spacex1spacex2spacex3spacex4As a quick test diskcopy was used to copy the disks to four formatted floppiesand the disk labels were removed by putting each floppy disk in the B: driveand then from the B: prompt typing Label and then return. Then instead ofgiving the disk a new name we just hit return to delete the volume label. Thenwe tried to install the game from the new floppies and the install program just kept saying please put disk 1 in drive B:  , OK this proved that the install program looks for the Volume Label so we will have to save the volumelabel when we Pkzip these disks for Uploading. After returning the volume labels to the copied disks we did a normal installand then ran the program. After the normal boot up sequence we were askedfor some word from the documentation on Page 3 line 6 word 3 or some shitlike that. This proved to us that the protection was the basic word look upversion and a simple crack patch was written by one of our Hackers to intercept the doc check and allow us to use the program no matter what our answer is. OK now that we have a good copy of the four floppies with the correct volumelabels and we have put the crack patch file spccrk.com and the Group.nfo fileon disk one we are now ready to .Zip the files and Upload them to our BBS. Putting Disk #1 in the B: Drive, and we have the file Pkzip.exe in the Dosdirectory or in any directory that is always in the Path command. from a dosprompt we issue the following command.c:\> Pkzip -P -R -$B c:\upload\spacex-1.zip b:\*.* OK the first command calls the Pkzip program.The next commands are Switches for the Pkzip Command. -P is the Path switch. In other words if the files contained on the floppy disk are in subdirectories then by using the -P the directory structure will be saved in the .Zip file. -R is recurse subdirectories. This command switch always goes with the -Pswitch so that the directory structure remains intact. Note. even if the Floppy disk contains no subdirectories it is a good habit to always use the -P -R switches. -$B  is the Volume label switch which simply says store the volume label fromthe disk in drive B in the .Zip file.  Remember always use the -$(drive) switch so that the (drive) is the drive in which the Floppy you are zipping is in. In other words if you were to simply use the -$ switch with out a (drive)the volume label saved to the .Zip file would be the Volume label of your C:\ hard drive.OK so now you have a zip file Named Spacex-1.zip in the upload directory allyou need to do now is zip up the other 3 files and your done. These commandswill do the trick.c:\> Pkzip -P -R -$B c:\upload\spacex-2.zip b:\*.*c:\> Pkzip -P -R -$B c:\upload\spacex-3.zip b:\*.*c:\> Pkzip -P -R -$B c:\upload\spacex-4.zip b:\*.*OK so now you have just Downloaded the following four zip files and cant waitto install the damn thing and play the game. For now we will unzip to floppiesand install. Later I will explain how to install using a Subst drive. First judging by the size of the zip files its pretty easy to tell we will need four 1.44 floppies formatted for this game. With the first disk in Drive B: issue the following command.  Dir B:  return.  Hopefully you will receive a File not found from the dos . If not delete the files on the disk or format it, whichever you prefer. Taking into account that the four zip files are in you Download directory change to that directory and with your floppy in drive B: Issue the following command from dos. C:\download > pkunzip -d -$ spacex-1 b: OK well the following explanation will be as follows. The pkunzip commandcalls the program Pkunzip located in your c:\dos directory just the same aswhen you called the Pkzip program earlier. The Switches are as follows. -D simply tells Pkunzip to put the files back onto the disk with the correctdirectory structure and subdirectories as when it was created using the -r -pswitches. -$ tells Pkunzip to label the destination disk with the Volume label stored in the Zip file if it is . And in which in this instance it was stored.OK now so after that floppy number 1 is done issue the following commands todo the other 3 floppy disks and you will be ready to install.C:\download > pkunzip -d -$ spacex-2 b:C:\download > pkunzip -d -$ spacex-3 b:C:\download > pkunzip -d -$ spacex-4 b:Now remember after you Unzip all four disks you need to use some kind oftext file viewer to look for files on disk 1 for installation info or etc before you install and try to run the program.  In this example you would find the file on disk 1 called group.nfo and in that file would be the typical information as to when the program was cracked. Who cracked it and the most important thing is that you need to install the program as normal then copy the file strcrk.com into the game directory after installation and then switchto that directory and run that crack program once before you try to play the game so that you will be able to Bypass the protection. Will that's about it. for the first example . Most programs will be somewhatsimilar to that but below are some more detailed explanations of most of thethings you can expect to run up against.Answers to common asked questions.Q. Why are some Zip files larger that a 1.44 Floppy disk.A. Will most software companies will use the entire 1.44 floppy disk beforestarting another and because most companies use there own compressionmethod when they store the files zipping the disk does not make it any smaller. Then with the crack patch and .Nfo files added they are larger thanthe floppy. Then when the file is uploaded to some Elite BBS the BBS softwarewill automaticly append there BBS advertisement to the disks and over and over. Sometimes the zip files are 1.48 or so in size....  This is no problem and also the reason that when you are Unzipping a file to your floppy disk youget a Disk full error... That is not usually a problem as the files are unzipped to a floppy in the same order as they were zipped so the Programfiles are always restored and its usually the BBS advertisements that get left off. NOTE: Remember that the important crack files and .nfo files may also be left off and even though they are not required to install the game they will probably be required to defeat the protection. Just remember that afteryou install to the floppies and you receive a disk full message then Unzip thesame file to your Hard drive in a temporary directory so that you can read thefiles in case you need them. Then delete them after you are finished with them.Q. What do I do if the Install program wont work to install the program.A. I find that occasionally some people install the program and in doing so all the files from the program are copied into a directory on the hard drive.Then that person does not have the original disks decides to Pkzip the installed game and upload it to a BBS. The problem is that when you unzip it and try to run the Install program it looks for what used to be on the original floppy disks and cant find the original file structure, It either aborts, locks up or whatever. No Problem thou. Usually you can just unzip allthe files to your hard drive and run the executable program required to run the program. Often there is a Setup.exe or similar program that will allow you to configure for your hardware etc..Q. Sometimes the Install fails and wants you to keep putting in the correct    disk , Whats up. A. Usually there are two reasons for this. (1) No or incorrect disk volumelabels. Sometimes they forget to save the volume labels using the -$ switch onsome of the disks. Check the volume labels of each disk by typing Label at theDos prompt. If one of the disks has a label like disk_1 then make sure you Label the other disks Disk_2 Disk_3 etc.... If you cant find any then sometimes the error message will give you a clue. Ie. If during the install process it says please insert the disk gameII-1 into the B: drive then try labeling the disks gameII-1  gameII-2  etc.... I even found a game once that would not install if any volume labels were present. The disks I used were old disks and even Though all the files were deleted before I unzipped to themthey still had there old volume labels and until I deleted them I could notinstall the game. (2) the other reason is that you may have left out the -Dswitch when you unzipped the files and the install program is looking for thefiles on the floppy disk in a subdirectory that does not exist. If this is thecase just Pkunzip again using the -D switch.Q. What do I do if there are CRC errors when Unzipping the files.A. Will it depends on which files are affected but one things for sure . Ifthe file fails the CRC check then it no good. You can try to install the program but most cases if the install program tries to install a file that had CRC errors It will most likely fail. Sometimes only unimportant BBS advertisements and such are affected . If you download a file using the Zmodem protocol and it has CRC errors don't bother downloading it again it wasn't in the transfer. Q. Whats up with crack files and how do they work.A. Will as you know the days of putting Errors on the floppies so that youcould not copy them is long gone as you see if they do that then the gamecannot be installed on the hard drive.If a game now days cant be installed on a hard drive then no one will buy it period. So the ever popular doc checkwhich requires you to look up something in the book is there to help thwartsoftware piracy. Most of the cracks are small TSR Memory resident programsthat will intercept the doc check answers and issue the correct answers to theprogram so that it will continue.. The best cracks are Byte cracks where theactual program is modified so that when the answer is checked and compared tothe correct one the program will branch to the correct code. Example. If thecorrect answer is input the program may Branch if equal to go run game. and ifthe incorrect answer is input the program may branch not equal to go to dos.One byte changed in the program and the program Branches to run game nomatter what answer is given.  Even the most difficult programs can be crackedeven if the cracker has to code in all the correct answers in the crack file.Q. Sometimes the programs install perfectly and they still don't run. Why.A. Well there are many reasons that can happen. First off as I said before ifyou don't have Msdos V6.0 then get it. Use memmaker to get your conventualmemory. All the hype about conventional memory is Bullshit. Sure you can get632k with qemm7 or 386max version 7 but first off you will have problemswith a lot of programs and second you don't need that much. I use memmakerfrom dos 6.0 and have about 615k conventual memory and no problems at all.With all that said about conventual memory I believe the most problems withnew programs are incorrect sound board settings. Sometimes the auto-detectsettings of the programs will incorrectly detect your IRQ settings and othertimes the software will just use the default settings and they may be wrong.First thing to try if you have problems getting a program to run is redo thesetup for no sound or PC Speaker. If the program then runs then you know itsa sound board problem. Sometimes you have to completely re-install theprogram to be able to re-configure it but most often you can just run eithersetup or Install from the program directory. Sometimes there are even optionsin the program itself to re-configure the sound. Most important thing to knowIs the 3 settings of your sound card. Example. Most sound Blasters and SoundBlaster Pros default to the following settings.IRQ  =  7Port =  220hDMA  =  1Most Sound Blaster 16 boards default to the following.IRQ  =  5Port =  220hDMA  =  1The most common problem I have is with my Sound Blaster 16. Most programsdon't have a setup for the 16 so I have to choose the sound blaster Pro andthen the program just configure for IRQ 7 and I am at IRQ 5 even though Mysound blaster 16 is 100% compatible with the Sound Blaster pro. A simplecustom setup of the program for IRQ 5 and I am ready to Rock and Roll.Q. Can I install the programs from the Hard drive without unzipping to all       Those floppy disks. A. I thought you would never ask. I very seldom Unzip programs to Floppydisks anymore. Especially with the new Msdos 6.0 SUBST Command. Firstthings First.More hard drive space is required to do this but if you have it its the bestway to install programs.. I will walk you thru the following Installation of a gamecalled Mystery that is 12 1.44 Meg Files., Without touching a floppy disk. Ifwe take for granted that the 12 .ZIP files are located in your C:\DownloadDirectory, Then we need to make a temporary Directory on the hard drive in order to install this game. I use C:\temp so go ahead and make that directorywith the following dos command.C:\Download > MD C:\tempThen from the Download directory where all the .Zip files are. By the way the.Zip files are named as follows Myst_01 thru Myst_12 for our example. Issuethe following dos command.C:\Download > Pkunzip -d Myst* c:\tempOK now that command will start with the first file found and start Unzippingthe files to the C:\Temp directory. Most Likely at some point during the second file one of the files will contain the same Filename as a file from the first .Zip file. Example The File File_ID.Diz will be on every disk so when it reaches the second on the Pkunzip program will Halt and Tell you that thesame file exists and wants to know if you want to Skip, Overwrite, ETC.The Command I always use is 'A' For always overwrite existing files. Thisway the Pkunzip program will continue to process all 12 .Zip files with outasking for confirmation of overwrite every time. Remember 99% of the timethe software companies will always have different filename on all of the filesand it will always be the .nfo and BBS Advertisements that are overwriting. OKafter all this is done you may want to delete the .ZIP files from your Harddrive if your running short of space. OK now we need to make Dos think thatthe files are on Floppies Instead of the Hard drive so this is where the SubstCommand comes in. From any dos Prompt issue the following command. C:\download> SUBST A: C:\TempWe have now substituted the c:\temp directory on your hard drive to the A:Floppy drive. You can substitute the B: Drive if you like the Install programdoes not care which Floppy you install from as long as it thinks its a Floppyand not the Hard Drive. Anyway now anytime you or any program trys toaccess the A: Floppy Dos will send it to the C:\Temp directory.Now switch to the Gigantic floppy by typing A: and return from the dosprompt. To test the Subst drive try Dir and you will see all those files fromthe Unzipping of the 12 files. OK enough fun now just type Install or setup and you are on your way to installing the game. Most often the complete game will install in a fraction of the time it would take from floppies. Sometimesit will hesitate between disk 1 and disk 2 etc asking you to put disk 2 in A:drive and press any key. Just press any key each time and your on your way.OK now that everything is installed look in your c:\Temp directory for any.NFO or readme files and any crack patches you may need and then once allthat is taken care of delete everything in the c:\temp directory. As I saidbefore most programs for Dos will install this way but there are exceptions.If you try this and it fails then Please read on as there are many other waysto Install programs without having to use floppies.Q. What if the Program files are overwriting and not just the .NFO files.A. Occasionally Software companies will have the same filename on each diskso that when you try to Unzip to the hard drive the file from Disk2 overwritethe file on disk 1 etc. In this case you will have to Multi-task to Install programs such as this.Q. I just hate to use floppies , Is there any way of avoiding this as the    hard drive is so much faster.A. YES!!! I will address this subject right now. I have only had to unzip tofloppies about 1 in 1000 programs. Here is a set of Examples. OK Lets assume the worst case, There are 12 files and each as a different Volume labelwhich is required by the install. Also the file names on each disk is the sameso that if you unzipped all 12 disks to the same directory they would overwrite and you would be left with only one file. This is what to do!. follow each step exactly. you can try this with any multi disk program justfor practice. Step 1.  Load Windows and Drop to a Full screen dos window by double clicking         on the Dos Prompt Icon.Step 2.  Unzip disk 1 to the Substitute B: Drive using the -D -$ . This will          only unzip the first disk and Label the Hard drive with the stored         Volume Label. The Volume Label will also be Present on the Subistuted         B: drive.Step 3.  Press "CTRL ESC" which will bring back Windows and the Task Manager.         From here select Program Manager and from the Program Manager Open         another Full screen Dos session.Step 4.  Now from the second DOS Window select B: and Type Install or Setup to         Start the installation process. The Installation will now proceed          properly as the correct volume label is present and only the correct          files from disk 1 are in the substitute drive. Now you will soon be          requested by the Install program to Please Insert disk 2.Step 5.  Press "CTRL ESC" Again and from the task manager screen select the         1st or other Dos window. From this dos window delete all the files in         B: and Unzip the second disk to B: which will also put the proper          files in the Substitute drive and re-Label the volume label as          required by the install program.Step 6.  As you should see by now just repeat this process until all the disks         have been processed and thats all there is to it.               Q. How do I get rid of a Subst drive so I can use my floppy again.A. Will you have to choices. This command will remove the subst drive in theabove example  SUBST A: /D as long as you don't try to issue that commandfrom the A:\> prompt.  Rebooting your computer will also eliminate the SubstDrive.I personally never use my 1.2 Meg Floppy Drive so I always Subst that drivefor c:\temp in my Autoexec.bat file. That way it is always there when I needit. I still have my 1.44 drive B: available for use with floppies. Q. If the Media was originally on 1.44 floppy disks and I use My 1.2 Meg          Floppy for the Subst Drive will I have problems.A. No! Most install programs only look to see if your installing from a floppydrive and not the hard drive so if it finds A: Or B: It will install fine.Q. How much space will be taken on my Hard drive using a subst Drive.A. Will in the above example without deleting files in between the process youcould have as much as 80 Megs of space used just to install one program. OKfollow me in this example.12 1.44 Meg .Zip files in the C:\download directory ====== 20 MegsAll those files Unzipped in to the c:\temp directory ===== 20 megsThe Game installed in the hard drive c:\game         ===== 40 megsRemember the 40 Megs installed is because the install program uncompressedthe files when it installed itself.Anyway it took 80 Megs to install but now you can delete everything except theinstalled game so your down to 40 Megs.Q. Will the Subst command work in Windows.A. Interesting question.  If you subst a floppy Ie SUBST A: C:\DOS orwhatever and load windows, then yes file manager will treat the A: drive as aSubstituted drive. Not much here is accomplished here because all programs will install in windows with out having to Unzip to Floppies. There are (2)    methods to install programs from the hard drive. Both will be covered in     complete detail .Q. It seems that there are a lot of programs that have a File called              Install.dat or disk.Id on each disk and when unzipping them to the hard drive the install.dat file always overwrite the next on so then the installation fails after after looking for the 2nd file. How Come?A. It is very common for the software companies to use the Install.datinstallation routine. What they do is have a text file on each disk calledInstall.dat that contains a list of all files on that disk with there respective sizes. Then the Install.exe program reads the Install.dat andinstalls those files checking to see if the size is correct on the list Thenyou insert the next disk and it reads the Install.dat file again and so on.This is a very convenient way for them as when they update the program a slight change to the install.dat and the same install program works. The problem for us is that after Unzipping multiple files to one Directory on thehard drive you see we only end up with one Install.dat file so when you run the Install.exe it installs only the files from one disk and stops asking formore disks with different Install.dat files. Some people get around this by making there own Install.bat containing a list of all the files from every disk so after they unzip all the files to the hard drive you copy the customInstall.dat over the one existing one and install from the subst drive. This reads the custom Install.dat and all the files are installed. An example ofthis can be found on the Patch for 3D Studio Version 3.0 for Subst Install. Also using windows to Multi-Task as in the example above is another effectivemethod to use to install programs such as this.Q. What is the best way to install programs in windows with out using floppiesA. No Problem. I have 2 methods that seem to work for 100% of allsoftware I have tried. First just forget about Subst Drives when working inwindows and Unzip all files to one Directory on your hard drive just as youwould with dos programs, Overwriting all files. Next load windows and theFile Manager and select the directory that contains the unzipped files. Example C:\temp   Then from the list of files in the right most window within file manager select Setup.exe or Install.exe just as if you were Installing from Floppies. This will load and run the install or setup program as normal.The exception to this is that the setup program will sometimes prompt you thatit cant find files and it is looking for them in the Disk1 directory or the Disk2 directory. This is very common and can easily be tricked. For exampleif the prompt is something like this Cant Find  [ c:\disk1\FileX ] then youknow its the Disk1 Directory trick.  Go to Dos and create a Disk? directory for every .Zip File the program has. Example if there are 4 .Zip Files Namedas follows in the c:\Download Directory.lots123-1.ziplots123-2.ziplots123-3.ziplots123-4.zipMake four directories on your hard drive as follows.MD C:\disk1MD C:\disk2MD C:\disk3MD C:\disk4Then Unzip the four files as follows. Pkunzip lots123-1 c:\disk1Pkunzip lots123-2 c:\disk2Pkunzip lots123-3 c:\disk3Pkunzip lots123-4 c:\disk4 OK then return to windows and select c:\disk1 from the File manager and selectSetup or install. The installation will proceed as normal. Then remember todelete all files and directories used in installation. This is an example that Iwould use after the program is installed from Dos. Deltree c:\disk1Deltree c:\disk2Deltree c:\disk3Deltree c:\disk4Ok will also if you have the same problem with files over writing then justas before only unzip one file at a time and switch between the WindowsFile Manager install program and a Full screen Dos window.Q. What are the commands for .ARJ files and are they similar to .ZipA. Sure. The one thing that is different is there is only one program to ARJ and Unarj files with the .ARJ Extension where as with PkWare there is Pkzip the Zip files and Pkunzip to Unzip files. The following examples are for ARJ.Remember you need version 2.41 or newer version of the file ARJ.EXE inyour C:\Dos directory.To arj all files from the B: Floppy to a file called game in the c:\waresdirectory issue this command from any dos prompt.ARJ -R -D -$B C:\wares\games B:\*.*Remember  -R   ===   Recurse Subdirectories          -D   ===   Store Full subdirectory Paths structure          -$B  ===   Store the Volume Label of the B:floppy disk To Unarj all the files from the above created .ARJ file in the Wares directoryback to a blank formatted floppy disk issue the following commandARJ X -$ C:\wares\games b:Remember   X   ===   Extract files using pull path and subdirectory structure          -$   ===   Put Volume Label on the B: disk if it exists in .ARJ fileNote: A few differences here between .ZIP and .ARJ  The X switch does notneed the - before it in fact it wont work if you use it. Other than thateverything is about the same.Q. Sometimes when I Unzip Multiple files to a disk all I end up with is Files   Like this.   PROGRAM.ARJ   PROGRAM.A01   PROGRAM.A02   PROGRAM.A03   PROGRAM.A03   ETC.....Also there is no install or anything so what do I do with this. A. These are ARJ Data Extension files. Most Likeley someone wanted to back upan Installed program on the Hard drive with multiple Subdirectories. If theywere to Zip this installed program the maybe the Zip file would be lets say20 Megabytes or so. Arj provides a way to Archive the intire Installed programand create seperate Data Extension files no Larger than the Type of Floppy youdesignate in the Command. I will not go into the proceedure to creat these archives as all that information is in the ARJ Docs and can get somewhat complicated. I will explain now how to Install these programs.In the above Example the following command would Install the Entire programin the C:\Programs Directory.ARJ X -Y Program.* C:\ProgramsOk the X Switxh is to Extract with Subdirectory StructureThe -Y is simply Answer 'Yes' To all questions. This is not required but ARJwill ask you every time before it created a Subdirectory. That can be a Painin the Butt so the -Y will take care of that.The Astrics (*) athe the end is required so that all the extensions (.ARJ,.A01.A02 etc are all merged together.There is a new PKZip Utility that will create these Data Extension files but I have yet to run across a program that was archived in this manner usink Pkzip.Q. Can you explain a little bit about how Pkzip and Arj files are stored. A. Sure. You see when normal Data is stored on the floppy disks there is a lotof repetitious strings of data thru out the files on the disks. What a compression program like Pkzip or Arj does is starting at the beginning of theprocess it will create one file and start by storing information about your floppy disk. First it stores how many files are there and how many subdirectories and stores the names and subdirectory structure within the .Zip file. Next it starts reading the Data and writes what it finds into the .Zip file in a Compressed encrypted code. It can do this by looking for strings of repetitive data, For example if it found 40 Consecutive ASCII Bytesof the value of 20 Which would represent spaces. It would write into the .Zipfile a 40-20,. You see that it only took 4 bytes to store ( 40-20, ) In the .Zip file where as it takes 40 Bytes on the Floppy to store 40 Spaces. As youcan see when the .Zip file is completed it is just simply a bunch of coded data that can at some point be Pkunziped back to a floppy in its original state. Two things are basicly accomplished by .Ziping a file and that simply is that we have only one file to work with that can represent hundreds of files from the floppy disk and that in most cases the Pkzip file will take up less space than the original floppy.Q. Why are some .Zip files actually larger than to combined size of the floppy     that was .zipped up.A. You see when software companies finish programming a large game forexample. They then must put the Data on Floppies in order to sell them. Theless floppies it takes the More prophet for them so they will also use acompression program like Pkzip to compress the files as they are stored to thefloppy. Now when we pkzip the floppy first the file and subdirectory structureis saved to the .Zip file and then the data is searched and written. But because the files are already Compressed, No repetitive sequences of data is found so no compression take place. Wa La the file we now have is larger thanthe original floppy. It is still just fine and great to work with as it is only one file but just not smaller.Q. Sometimes after I install a program I cant find a file in the program               directory that will run the program Why?.A. Will one of the things some software manufactures do is put all of theprogram files in a directory and then put the program that you need to run inorder to start it in the Root directory of the hard drive that way you can type that name from any dos prompt and the program will load. The reason for this is that the root directory is always in the path. I personally always copy these files to the directory in which the program is installed and then all I have to do is switch to that directory before I run the program.Q. Could you give me some more examples of using Pkzip, Pkunzip, And arjso that I fully understand the concept behind this compression commands.A. OK will do it in the following format with examples using some of the           switches available. always look at the dos prompt I give so you understand   what the current directory is when I issue the command.C:\> Pkzip -r -p D:\Cbackup c:\*.*      This command backs up the entire c:hard drive with one file in the root directory of the D: drive namedCbackup.zipC:\? Pkzip d:\cBackup c:\*.*    This command like the one above will make afile in the root directory of D: named Cbackup.zip the same as above but thiszip fill will only contain the files in the root directory of the C:\ drive because we left out the -R -P switches there will be no subdirectories or files in those subdirectories stored in the zip file.C:\> Pkzip c:\temp\games c:\games\game1.exe game2.exe game3.exeThe above command will create a .Zip file named games.zip in the c:\tempdirectory and that file will contain the 3 game?.exe files found in the c:\games directory.C:\> Arj X -R D:\Cbackup C:\*.*   Same as the first >zip example thiscommand will create an entire backup of your C:\ drive and store it in the root directory of D:\ with the filename Cbackup.arjC:\> pkunzip -D -$ -O C:\download\game* c:\temp    This, the most commoncommand used when installing files on your hard drive will Unzip all files inthe C:\download directory that have a file name starting with game to the tempdirectory on your C:\ drive. for example if you have the following files in your C:\download directory.Game-1.zipGame-2.zipGame-3.zipAll these files will be unzipped to the C:\temp directory. The switches will do the following.-D  Creates subdirectories on the C:\temp directories if they exist in the zipfile.-$ rename the volume label of your C:\ hard drive with the Volume label stroedin the Zip file.-O Always overite existing files if they exisit.I hope these are enough examples to get you started. If all else fails read the documentation found on the Pkware or Arj installation disks for completeexplanation of these commands. Also typing either Pkzip /h or Pkunzip /h at ados prompt will give you some help templates to check out explaining thetemplates etc...Q. Is there any other ways to compress Floppy disks other than Pkzip or Arj.                        A. Sure. You see because pkzip and arj can only handle normal dos filestructures and occasionally some software companies put some Non Dos dataon there installation disks Pkzip and arj are unable to duplicate these floppies. There are several programs that will make an entire Image copy ofthe floppy disk but the 2 most popular are Teledisk and DDD (Dan's disk duplicator). Both work in the same manner. They will read each track and sector of the floppy disk and store the data in one large file with the extension .TD0 for teledisk and .DDD for Dan's. This works fine as long as you use the same media to undo the files that was used to store them in the first place. In other words if the file for example game.TD0 was created froma 720K floppy disk you cannot Un teledisk that file to a 1.44 or 1.2 meg floppy. Only a 720K floppy. A good example of this is found when you try to use the Windows NT downloaded from the BBS. Because Microsoft put some abnormal hidden files on the disk number 1 you cannot Pkzip or Arj disk one. That is why when you Unzip the windows NT file number 1 you will see a large file called winnt.DDD and the DDD.exe file. This is the Disk number 1 Image file and the Dans Disk Duplicator program. All you have to do is Put a 1.44 floppy disk in your drive B: and from the directory on your hard drive that the .TD0 and the DDD.EXE file are found Type DDD.exe winnt.td0 b: and the B: disk will be formatted and written to so that the original disk1 of windows with abnormal hidden file and everything are there. Then just unzip the other 21 files to floppies and install.                        Authors Note: #1               July 20Th 1994      It has been a Year since I just updated this document. There are afew comments I would like to Make to keep you up to date. As of now 7-20-94CD'S Thank god have still not caught on and most software is still beingreleased on floppies.  Programs have grown Larger which has caused me to Stop the Downloading of Software and Switch to (D.A.T.) Tape Backup. The presentamount of IBM Uploads each Month is about 1.5 to 1.9 Gigabytes. The DATTapes hold 2.0 Gigs of Uncompressed Data so I just purchase the Tape each month. The IBM PC has been going thru the roof in Popularity. The Commodorehas finally Die'ed as Commodore has recently filed Bankrupcy and is goingthru liquadation at this very moment. Prices of PC Clones are dropping likeHOT Cakes as Ram, Hard Drives etc.prices are dropping every day. Pentium processors have not been as popular as predicted but that will change asCPU Prices drop. Many companies are producing Competitve CPU'S like Cirrix AMD. It will be interesting to see if they can take some of the Monopoly away from INTELL. Microsofts Windows (4) -Chicago- should be released thisFall of 94 and the question is , Will it be more of the same or a truly great multi tasking operating system like the Amiga has had for 10 years.Pre Release Betas have it looking just like the Macintosh!Authors Note: #2               January 26 1995     OK so much for CD-Roms not catching on. Starting at the end of 1994just before Christmas most companies have decided to release all software onCD-Rom and Floppies with more and more releasing on only CD-Rom. The followingquestion and answer session is done to update you on the ever changing worldof pirating software. I have eliminated the Phreaking section of this manualas it doesn't pertain to the reason this was written. I am still getting software on DAT Tape but its up to about 3 Gigs a month and with the most popular software today being the CD-Rom Rips this next section will cover justthat subject.Q.   When I purchase a CD-Rom game from the store, Does that mean it willbe a monster game and can I be sure it will be better than the Floppy version.A.   NOPE!  No way, Most CD Rom releases consume only 15 to 50 Megs ofinformation on the CD. That doesn't mean it isn't an awsome game it just meansthere is no Guarantee that you will get 300 to 500 Megs on that game. In fact there are many CD-Rom programs that take as little as 3 Megabytes. Thatleaves 647 Megs free on that CD. Some companies like Apogee for example,When you by Rise of the Triad CD-Version you get the same Version as the Floppy but they also include the shareware version of every game they evermade.Q.   How do I know if Im getting a good value for my Money when I purchaseA CD. I cant try it an return it. Do I just take a chance.A.   Will one way is to get the GOLD Series CD Listings from my BBS andLook them over. They list many different CD'S on each Disk and Give the Sizeof each program. This is an example of GOLD-5 for the IBM.TITLE                            manufacture           VERSION     SIZE-------------------------------------------------------------------ECSTATIC                         PSYGNOSIS               CD        29 MEGSINFERNO                          US GOLD                 CD        97 MEGSPGA PRO TOUR 486 GOLF            EA SPORTS               CD        233 MEGSLORDS OF THE REALM               IMPRESSIONS             CD        101 MEGSMICROSOFT MULTIMEDIA GOLF        MICROSOFT/ACCESS        CD        86 MEGSZORRO                            CAPSTONE                CD        86 MEGSYou can see right off the bat what the size of the CDs are. Compare this Gold disk with Gold-01 and you will see many CD Titles under 8 Megs.Buy the way this is one of the Latest ways to Pirate software. I offer theseGold disks for $40.00 each. As you can see that way you get multiple CDGames for one around the cost of one CD game. These Gold disk also offer anadvantage over other software as they Install and work exactly like the store bought CD'S. No .ZIP Files to fool with. No complicated installation.Just change directory to your CD rom and type Gold. You will be presented withan Installation menu to install any of the games on the cd. All Plug and Play.Also the CD Games that are designed to play from the CD'S will do so just thesame so all your Hard drive space isn't robbed.Q.   What exactly does CD-Ripped Mean?A.   It means that the program has been taken directly from the OriginalCD-Rom. This can mean many things. It may be 100% Exactly like the Originalor it may be only working parts of the program. I will follow this with some examples so you will get the Idea!(1) DARK Forces CD-Rip 50 Megs. This is the full version of Lucas arts DOOM    II Killer, Dark Forces. When you purchase this CD Title from the store    and proceed to install it, You will have 2 option's Minimal Install (5)    Megs or Full install (70 Megs). The instruction suggest that you do the    full install if you have the hard drive room because the game will play so     much better. The CD Rip is the Full 100% Installed version. The only    difference between this release on CD-Rom 17 and the Original CD Is that    you cannot do a minimal install and play off the CD-Rom drive.(2) Disc World (Psygnosis)  When this Original CD Game is purchased, It     contains about 30 Megs of Game and music, And 300 Megs of Digital Voice    files. The CD Rip from CD-Rom #17 contains everything except the 300 Meg    Voice files. When you install this CD-Rom Rip you need to set the sound    card configuration for Music but No Digital Speech sound card. That way    all Interaction is written to the screen for you to read instead of the    character actually speaking. This CD Rip is exactly like the Floppy disk     version.(3) X-COMM II Terror from the DEEP CD-Rom Rip. This is Exactly like the     Original store bought CD Rom. No Difference. It is a Major graphic and    sounds improvement from the Floppy version although game play is the     same.     The above three examples pretty much cover CD-Romm Rips. There have also been CD-Rom ripps released that are complete Abortions. They are soripped apart that they are almost impossible to play but I do not post theseon my filelists.Q.   Please explain how CD Rom Rips are packaged.A.   Will because of the vast storage capacity of CD-Roms (650 Megs) mostcompanies don't compress the files on the CD, And because Pirating CD-Romsis almost un-Heard of (Hehe) they don't use much protection. At most the onlyprotection I have ever seen is that the program actually looks to make surethe CD Is in the CD Rom drive. A simple CD-Rom Check Crack is all that is needed to defeat this. The easiest way to ripp a cd would be to PkZip the entire CD-Rom. Ie. PkZip.exe -R -P c:\game\ripoff E:\*.* example would createa file in the games dir of C:\ named ripoff.zip . Only problem here is thatfile could be huge, Like 50 Megs and most people don't have enough BBS Timein one session to download 50 Megs. Therefore we need to split the file intosmaller chunks. The size of a 1.44 Floppy seems to be the standard. This isnot done so as to put this rip on floppies but rather give you the ability todownload a few files each time you call the BBS. Also by using a program likeARJ.EXE we can get maximum compression as most cd's do not contain compressedfiles. There is a simple command line parameter that will ARJ Any CD-Rom, Fileor Groups of files into multiple .ARJ Files. As explained earlier in thisdocument when this is done it typical creates ARJ Data extension files asfollows.GAME.ARJGAME.A01GAME.A02GAME.A03ETC....... Each file being 1.44 Kb in size. There is other ways to do the ARJ but the bottom line is if you see files with extensions like .A01 or .001 .002 .003etc. The its probably ARJ Files. Q.   How do I go about taking these Data extension files and making the        game install or run?A.   The answer is lots of Hard drive space. To begin thou you need to Un Arj the files as follows.ARJ X -v -y GAME.ARJ d:\tempThe above example would Un-Arj and create an exact image of everythingthat was on the CD and do it in the Temporary directory on D Drive. You canthen Delete the .Arj, .A01 etc files to free up some hard drive space as youare done with these. Now you will most likely need to Install the game justas if you wer installing the game from the CD-Rom. In order to sucsesfullydo this you will most likely need to Substitute your D:\TEMP Directory foranother drive so that the Install program will seem to think its a CD-Rom drive and not the subdirectory of your D:\ Hard disk. Do the following.(1)  Make sure that the LastDrive command in the Autoexec.bat = Z(2)  From Dos Type   SUBST H: D:\TEMP  Where H: does not exist on your     system and D:\TEMP Is where you Un-Arjed to.(3)  Change directory to H: and type Install or Setup. Or if Its Windows     Load windows and Run Setup from the H: drive in Filemanager.(4)  Proceed as required but make sure that if give more than one Install     method, You choose Full install so that all files are installed to the     hard drive.(5)  After this is complete you can DEL all files in D:\TEMP or      Deltree d:\temp (6)  Try to run the game. If there is an error message, Cannot find CD-Rom     or C:\Game is not a CD-Rom drive ETC... Then you will need to Patch it     with a crack or whatever it takes. Read the .NFO Files on the 1st Zip     file for all information needed to get it going.   That's basicly all there is to it. Its pretty much common sense and will worththe effort to get these awsome releases working.Q.   I have come across some games that have .001 .002 .003 - .027 filesand when I try to un-Arj them I get a Not An ARJ File. Whats up!A.   Yup! Some Idiot group out there has decided to use Pkzip to Rippthe CD'S and then break them down using another program like Carve or Zipchucker pro. When done with Zip Chunker pro and that program is also on thedisk the it works pretty good. Just use Zip Chunker pro to reasemple all thefiles back to one huge zip file and then Unzip that file to the temporary directory. other than requiring more Hard drive space to get thru the installprocess there is not a problem with this.  The problem is with a programcalled CARVE.EXE. It seems a if the person was sucsesfull in Carving the monster zip file down into 1.44 Kbyte files but when we use Carve.exe to Putin back together it fails.Q.   OK so I have 29 Files with .001 thru .029 and CARVE.EXE wont put themback into one big zip file. What can I do.A.   Will its a Piece of Cake! (Hehehe) You may have to think about it forA while but this will work.  OK we are going to use the DOS Join Option withinthe COPY Command. If you want more information about the Dos COPY Commandtype Help Copy from any DOS Prompt.      We would like to join all of these 29 files together but DOS wontlet use type that long of a command line so we will join them 5 at a timeuntil we get 6 files then we will join the six into one. Confused? Justfollow along and I think you will get the Idea. The 29 files are namedGAME.001   GAME.002  ---------- thru GAME.029(1) From the Dos prompt type exactly line exactly pressing enter after each     line also make sure your current directory is where all the files are.     Also make sure you have enough hard drive space available.COPY /B GAME.001 + GAME.002 + GAME.003 + GAME.004 + GAME.005 NEW.001COPY /B GAME.006 + GAME.007 + GAME.008 + GAME.009 + GAME.010 NEW.002COPY /B GAME.011 + GAME.012 + GAME.013 + GAME.014 + GAME.015 NEW.003COPY /B GAME.016 + GAME.017 + GAME.018 + GAME.019 + GAME.005 NEW.004COPY /B GAME.020 + GAME.021 + GAME.022 + GAME.023 + GAME.024 NEW.005COPY /B GAME.025 + GAME.026 + GAME.027 + GAME.028 + GAME.029 NEW.006DEL GAME.*    ;(rem) FREE UP SOME HARD DRIVE SPACECOPY /B NEW.001 + NEW.002 + NEW.003 + NEW.004 + NEW.005 + NEW.006 FINAL.ZIPDEL NEW.*    ;(rem) FREE UP SOME MORE HARD DRIVE SPACE     At this point you will be left with one MONSTER File called Final.zipand if you typed everything correctly you can now Unzip that file to yourtemporary directory. Ie: D:\TEMP and then delete that BIG! .Zip file. Its a little more complicated but the end result is the same. If you don't use theDOS Command line history utility (DOSKEY) The start as it will save you a lotof time typing commands.(2)  Now go to the temporary directly and install the game.Q.   I install the CD-Rom Rips and even crack to CD Check but the gamewont run. It keeps saying that MsCdex isn't loaded and I do not have a CDRom in my computer so I cant load it. Is there anything I can do?A.   Sure! You need the file CDEMU2.COM Its a small MSCDEX Cd Rommdriver for network drives. That means it wont check your system to see if theirs a CD-Rom installed because it assumes it could be on another computeron A network. Just put the file in your Dos Directory and from the dosPrompt type CDEMU2 H: where H: is a Subistuted drive.  You could create a small batch file to load the game as follows.MD C:\temp1                  ;REM  Make phoney dir for substitute driveSUBST H: C:\temp1            ;REM  Substitute Phony drive for H:C:\DOS\CDEMU2.COM H:         ;REM  Load MSCDEX Driver for H:cd\Games                     ;REM  Change to the Game directoryGame.exe                     ;REM  Load GameSUBST /D H:                  ;REM  Remove Subistuted drive with /D SwitchRD C:\temp1                  ;REM  Remove Temporary directory (House Cleaning)NOTE:  MSCDEX does not have to point to the drive with the game. Its just that       the game will check to see if MSCDEX is running.Q.   The CD Games take so much hard drive space Isn't is just better to BUY The CD.A.   Will I always condone supporting the Software Authors but I don't believe your argument is Valid. I just purchased A 1.3 GIG Western Digitalhard drive for $325.00. It wouldn't take purchasing very many CD Rom gamesat $49.00 to buy a couple of them. Also If you buy A CD and it a piece ofshit game then your out. Getting it from me and you just delete it from yourhard drive and move on to the next one. Hell one thing is for sure. When a CD Rom game is 100% Installed to the Hard drive it plays much better and faster than when its loading scenes from the CD-Rom. Even Quad speed is slowcompared to a hard drive.Q.   What will we do when all of the CD Games are two big to put on theHard drive. when there over 100 Megs its not worth it.A.   That's why I now offer GOLD Series disks. These are disks that containmany CD Games on One CD-Rom. with some games as big as 600 Megs. That will bethe future for a while. As the CD Programs get bigger the price of blank CD'swill come down. At some point I believe we may carry our portable CD-Romdrives from house to house copying CD'S just as we did for years with floppydisks. If and when they introduce CD-Rom Disc based Protection like putting certain physical errors on the disc's then it could get interesting but fornow we change with the times and have FUN!      FINAL Comments for April 27 1994.     Commenting on past issues. Clone CPU Makers have finally caught up with INTEL. AMD Is selling more DX/4 100 Megz CPUs in one month than INTELwill sell is 6 Months. Cirix still hasn't caught on to much but after the INTEL Pentium Math bug INTEL has lost some of its market share. As for PCoperating systems IBM/Warp is still the most user friendly for running DOSand windows programs. As for Windows 95, Bill Gates held to his Promise and removed all support for your Previous DOS Operating system. In fact when youInstall the newest Beta the install program deletes all of your Dos Commandsand replaces them with Win95 commands. This is a Bold move by Microsoft because if they can get it to fly they would have a Monopoly on PC Computers.If you decide to use Windows 95 then you will need to Buy or use all Windowsprograms because the Dos support is worth shit anymore. Because of this therehas been a ton of BAD Press on Win95 forcing Microsoft to delay its releaseuntil Aug 1994. Microsoft did decide to release some 400,000 copies at $29.00each. This is just a bullshit smoke screen. Its there way of releasing theprogram for sale but still calling it a late Beta. That way the press cant beto hard on them. I personally hope the whole Product Dies!. But! Of course itwont. Bill Gates isn't the richest man in the world because he is stupid.Although after releasing a program like MICROSOFT BOB One would have to wonder about him.                          Bad boy!                                           The WarEZhouse BBS                                           (209) 772-9165                                           USR V-34 Everything 28.800                                           5 Gigs Hard drive                                           12 Gigs 100% Check software                                           Software available on                                           4MM/90M D.A.T.
