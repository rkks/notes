Just start out on Emule and still a beginner.

The speed is really killing me, even configured ports 4662 & 4672. I got high ID but the quene is round up to hundreds before I capable to get any files.

I always keep my upload speed @ 20kbs, but d/l speed still suck. The speed only pick-up after 40minutes but not over 30kbs even there are 300 resource of sharing files.

Gone thru a lot of searches hope to get stuff from emule faster.

And here is one way to optimize the bandwidth for emule, which not on the manual.




CODE
With Windows 2000/XP:

Open "regedit.exe" and do the following:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEM]
CurrentControlSet
  Services
   Tcpip
    Parameters
Set as: "GlobalMaxTcpWindowSize"=dword:00007fff

[HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT]
Software
Microsoft
 Windows
  CurrentVersion
    Internet Settings
Set as: "MaxConnectionsPerServer"=dword:00000020
"MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server"=dword:00000020

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER]
Software
Microsoft
 Windows
  CurrentVersion
    Internet Settings
Set as: "MaxConnectionsPerServer"=dword:00000020
"MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server"=dword:00000020




I heard someone mention earlier that BT engine can speed up emule but don't know it's true.
