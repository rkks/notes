* If sfc discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the %systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder, and then replaces the incorrect file.
* If the %systemroot%\system32\dllcache folder becomes corrupt or unusable, use sfc /scannow, sfc /scanonce, or sfc /scanboot to repair the contents of the Dllcache directory.

Command-line reference A-Z

Please note that this Command Line reference is to varify the integrity of the WindowsXP DLL's that were shipped with Windows XP. It will try to repair damaged DLL's by prompting for the Windows CD.

The Windows XP System File Protection which remains active in the background monitors these DLL's and if it detects an altered DLL will alert a user with a popup message asking for the Windows XP CD. This is so that it can revert the corrupt DLL back to its original state.

SFC checker in Windows XP can only be ran by an Administrator and is not ran in the same way as its previous incarnation from the Windows 98 OS.
