Exploseek, a simple tool to find music on the net

Why should I use Exploseek ?

Exploseek is a nice simple tool to find music on the net. It is possible to use the major search engines to type your queries, but if you use this tool it will be much easier as some of you have probably seen already. We always try to improve the queries, if possible, and will update it at random times. Further you don't need to install a peer-to-peer program with possible spyware and other security issues, the price to pay is that you will not always find as much as such a program, but on a lucky day you find a load of music.
