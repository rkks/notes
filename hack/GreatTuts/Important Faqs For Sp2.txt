After installing SP2 and reboot my system, I receive this message "Your network administrator can unblock this program for you". Why is this so and what should I do?
This is because you are not the administrator of this system. You should use an administrator account to log in to unblock this program.
After logging in as an administrator, you can either choose to 'Keep Blocking' this program or 'Unblock' this program or 'Ask Me Later' when I run that program again as shown below.

When I am surfing to some websites using Internet Explorer, I notice that Internet Explorer does not display some of the pop-up windows? Why is this so and what should I do to display these pop-up windows?
When you install SP2, the pop-up blocker is turned on in Internet Explorer. It will block most automcatic pop-ups but it will play a sound and show the Information Bar when a pop-up is blocked as shown below.

To temporarily or always allow pop-ups from that website, click the Information Bar when it notifies a pop-up has been blocked. Choose the correct setting as shown below.

If you choose to 'Always Allow Pop-ups from This Site', it will prompt you to confirm again to permanently trust this website to allow pop-ups. Click 'Yes' if you are sure.
