But    this can be beat. At current rates, CIS (Compuserve) charges $6.50 for300 baud    and $12.75 for 1200/2400 baud, 9600 can only be accessed byHardwired clients. Thus you see the need for this file. At the timethis was  written, all information in this file was correct. Enough ofthis, on to the file.    Logging on to Compuserve    ------------------------    In order to create a Ziff Account on CompuServe you need ...     1) A Telenet, Tymnet, Or CIS Port     2) A Credit Card     3) Above the IQ of a houseplant    That is all you need, I know for some of you the 3rd one istough, but try. Ok, you have all this, call your local port, logon toCIS, then  you should get a [User ID:] Prompt, type [177000,5000], thisis the Ziff PCMagnet User Id. Now, if you entered it correctly, then youshould get  the [Password:] Prompt, at This type [Pc*Magnet]. You willnext be givena Welcome Message, then, you will get yet another Prompt. Itshould ask you for your Agreement Number, type [Z10D8810]. That is theend of the prompts. Here's where the IQ of above a houseplant comes intoplay.You now have to think. It will ask you various questions,ranging from your country to your Social Security number. Answer themhowever you  want, but I wouldn't use your real info. If you want thesecond password (Needed to access some things), you will have to give anaddress where  you can drop by and pick it up. Some ideas are sending toyour neighbors,but use your last name, it will end up at your house. Thatisn't the safest thing. Or you can rent a Post Office box for about 6months. Once you have done all this, and answer the questions, andread the propoganda, you will see [Entering PCMagnet]. You are done.    So what do I do Now?    --------------------    Ok, if you get this far, you have the IQ of above your fern.You can  go one of two places, CIS or PCMagnet (Where you are now).You can stay in PCMagnet, but there isn't much there. So, I wouldtype [Go Cis] This will bring you to Compuserve. Once on CIS, you can domany thing, ranging from downloading files, to real time chat on forumsto online games.    Project Numbers    ---------------    Some times I will refer to the word Project Number, that isthe same thing as a User ID. Excluding the digits after the comma. Ifyou see an ID that is [72311,27] then the that  User ID's ProjectNumber is[72311]. Simple Eh?    [70000,xxx] - Security Personel or Important Employes    [70003,xxx] - Complementary Account    [70004,xxx] - CompuServe Employe    [70005,xxx] - Radio Shack *Demo* Account. (R Flagged)    [70006,xxx] - Normal Compuserve Employe (Sometimes Wizards)    [70007,xxx] - Complementary Account    [70000,753] - Dan'l, Ghost, or Dan Piskur    [70006,522] - LooLoo, Myrtl, or Patrica Phelps    The [70000] Projects are very interesting accounts, they havevery high powered Flags. (Incedently, a Flag is an option set onthe user account) These accounts have the capability to 'Hang you up'from the system. These are the only such account that can do so.But as you will see, they can make things very difficult withouthanging you up. A non [70000] project can get you 'Hung up', theyhave to  call Customer Service and tell them to Initilize your Port.Thus hanging you up. But only the [70000] project can suspend youraccount. The main person to look out for is [70000,753 - Dan Piskur]he is   the Head of Security. His job is to find you and suspend youraccount. He does not hesitate to do this.    The [70006] is also another intersting Project. Theseaccounts are USUALLY 'Wizards' (A Wizard is a user with very high accessFlags) That does not mean all [70006,xxx] are Wizards, but most are.So  if you see the ID [70006,522] that is a very high accessedWizard, she usually uses the name [*LooLoo*] she has Sysop Flags onall forums, where most Sysops only have it on their specificforum. She also has the job of finding you , but she must report toDan'l to get you suspended. But don't take her for granted, she hasthe C Flag, she can stop you from talking, you can functionnormally,but you can not talk in whatever Confrence Area she has/gag'ed you on. (/gag is the Command to stop you from talking) She thenreports the User ID to Dan'l. He suspends you. Case Closed.    Invisable Sysops    ----------------    Sysops with the C Flag can make them selves invisable whilein Confrence. But this has one bug in it. If you do a [/ust]while in Confrence, the Inviso sysop will not appear, but if youexit [/ex] and do a [ust] at the ! Prompt, they will appear.Another way is to count the members it say are in CO at the Forum Top    menu [4. Confrencing (9 Participating)] and you go into CO,and do a ust, count the people, in all channels and Tlk, if thereis  an Inviso, there will be one less person when you count theUst.Maybe more if there are more Inviso's.    Glossary    --------    Flags     : Specific Options on your account.    -C Flag   : Specific Account Option - Gives the use of the                /wi commands at CO. (Syntax [/wi ?])    Free Flag : Specific Account Option - Makes time in aspecific                forum free. (Ususally 70003 and 70007)    -L Flag   : Specific Account Option - Locks a your account                out of a forum.    -R Flag   : Specific Account Option - Read Only, means that                the account can not write to the system, read                and download only. (See also Radio Shack Demo)    Gag'ed    : An account flag, if you have this flag, you can                not speak while you are in CO or CB. You can not                be seen in the User Listing, except by yourself.                A quick test for this flags is Paging yourself.                If you are gag'ed, there are three ways ofgetting                rid of this flag, but you have no control overthem                 - 1 - Have the Sysop who gag'ed you ungag you.                       Only the sysop who gag'ed you can Ungagyou!                 - 2 - Wait till 5am, when the system resets and                       it will clear the flag. (Useful only onCB)                 - 3 - The best. When everyone leaves the CO you                       were in, your flag will automaticly clear.                [Note.
