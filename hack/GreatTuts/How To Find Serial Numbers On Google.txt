ok, this is a little trick that i usually use to find cd keys with google.


if your looking for a serial number for nero (for example) goto google.com and type nero 94FBR and it'll bring it up

this works great in google

HOW DOES THIS WORK?

Quite simple really. 94FBR is part of a Office 2000 Pro cd key that is widely distributed as it bypasses the activation requirements of Office 2K Pro. By searching for the product name and 94fbr, you guarantee two things.

1)The pages that are returned are pages dealing specifically with the product you're wantinga serial for.

2)Because 94FBR is part of a serial number, and only part of a serial number, you guarantee that any page being returned is a serial number list page.


I hope this trick help you finding your ccd keys easily

Enjoy :)
