Anyone here think about getting xbox live but not have enough money to pay for the starter kit...

WELL GUESS WHAT!!!!!!!!

You can now get it without paying a cent (that is if you have a free 2 month trial)

First go to http://www.xbconnect.com/downloads.php and download the current version of XBConnect...

Secondly you must get a Ethernet cable and connect your X-BOX to your router (if you have, you MUST have one BTW)

Thirdly install and open xbconnect. Create a new account .......

Fourthly go on www.xbox.com/live and sign in your .NET passport and create a profile for xbox live

Fifthly open your xbox with a xbox live supported game and follow the setup for xbox live ....

And YOUR DONE!!!!!
