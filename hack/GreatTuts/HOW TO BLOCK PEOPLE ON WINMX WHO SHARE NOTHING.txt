
Some people seem to think our network is a kind of a store a they just pick what they want without sharing anything!
(and other considere our net as a schoolyard where one "trade"... Childish!)

*********************

You can help everybody getting rid of them by boycotting them that way:

You "browse" each uploading user.


** If he/she shares more than, say, a hundred files (and NOT in the WinMx directory only, putting them elsewhere and unshared when entirely downloaded !!!), OK.
NB: a hundred is not a lot but 1- we don't all have a large HDD and some files are big 2- when you begin...!                                                                              
** If not:

You can send a message to him/her to ask why there is no real share, or not at all, for they can have forgotten to do so: give them a chance! The first time, I didn't understand that I had to choose the shared files types, so I shared nothing, unwillingly. Somebody told it to me in a message.

If no answer and/or still no shared file, you can exclude the selfish beast:
(Thanks to dwhite who gave the modus operandi on the WinMx net)

To block somebody from downloading, add the name to your HOTLIST (right-click the name then "Add to hotlist") then to your IGNORE list.

You won't receive any messages nor will they enter your queue, during that session at least.

On the contrary, you can help people who share a lot by starting the tranfer when they are in your queue, or give a higher bandwith priority...
