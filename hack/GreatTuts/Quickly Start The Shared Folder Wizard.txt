Quickly Start The Shared Folder Wizard

Want to share a folder, or multiple folders, quickly and easily?

You can invoke the Shared Folder Wizard by typing shrpubw.exe at the Run box or command line. The wizard takes you through the process of setting up a shared folder and allows you to start the process over within the same wizard, which is especially good if you want to make multiple folders shared.
