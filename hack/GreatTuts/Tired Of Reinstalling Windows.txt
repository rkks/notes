 Tired Of Reinstalling Windows

  My Suggestions For A Better And Easier Computing:

-> First partition ur HDD as follows. C: (primary, bootable) 10GB, D: (ur choice), E: (10 GB)

-> Next install 2 OSs, it can be XP,XP or XP,9X. One OS in C: and other E:
Let OS in C:\ be called "TRASH" and that in E:\ be called "GOOD"

-> Boot into GOOD OS. Install all the important software (image viewer, winamp, winrar, acrobat, ms-office etc) in E:\program files\. Tweak all you settings, Install all the latest drivers, AV, service packs, patches etc and do the same for TRASH if you want! ALSO INSTALL THE IMAGING SOFTWARE.

-> Now boot to TRASH OS and move the "E:\Documents and Settings" to D:\ and change the default Desktop folder and My Documents folder to d:\doc & settings of TRASH OS. (right click on My Doc, Properties. There just change E: to D:\ or manually "MOVE") for changing desktop u need a tweak program (I use X-Setup, fast and free) NOW INSTALL THE IMAGING SOFTWARE.

-> Depending on ur requirements, allocate pace for D: (say 15 GB). Now OS in E: is the main OS is called GOOD (just for easy identification). and the OS in C:\ is standby and is called TRASH (again this is for easy identification)

DONT FORGET TO ON BOTH THE OS. (I use Paragon HDD Manager, it is fine. The compression is good)

-> Boot into GOOD OS. and change the default Desktop folder and My Documents folder to d:\documents and settings.

-> Boot into TRASH OS. Defragment E:. Now load the imaging program, take the image or save image to file (NOT DRIVE COPY) and store safely (if it is on secondary hdd it is good) or if dont have one, save it to different partition or save on CD.

For installing image viewer, winamp, winrar, acrobat, ms-office and other must have apps use the Program Files folder (E:\)


Now you are done!

Since documents and settings is in D:\, if u restore from image, your private files are NOT lost.
The OS in C: is TRASH and the OS in E: is GOOD. These are just labels for better identification.



Use E:\ OS or GOOD as your primary OS. After this install any software utls to D:\. Sort software in categories like video, audio, dvd, cd, internet, graphics, protection etc. and install each app in thier sub-folder under the category.

If anything goes bad, goto standby OS, load Imaging app, restore the E-drive.
