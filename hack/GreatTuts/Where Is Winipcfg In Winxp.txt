 If any body remembers or misses the old "winipcfg", which is missing from Windows XP, then there is a easy way to get this back from Microsoft.

Instead of using the command line to display or configure your ip with "ipconfig", you can download wntipcfg from Microsoft which gives you the same GUI as the old winipcfg.

Download:
CODE
http://microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/tools/existing/wntipcfg-o.asp


Then follow these steps:

Install it (the default is c:\program files\resource kit\ )
Copy wntipcfg.exe to c:\windows
Rename it to winipcfg.exe
Now you can just click on run, then type in "winipcfg".
