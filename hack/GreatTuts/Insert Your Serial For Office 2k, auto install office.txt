Auto-insert your Office2k serial number


Hate having to find your serial number every time you need to install something from your Office2k CD?
How would you like it pre-filled in for you?
Here's how:

On your Office2k CD, there's a file named SETUP.INI. Open it, and look for the [Options] section.
Modify it to look like this:

[Options]
; If a value is present, the [Options] section gives the values of properties to apply to
; this installation. Specify them in the format:
; PropName=PropValue
; Remember to uncomment both the section name and the value names.
;
USERNAME=Customer
PIDKEY=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY


Use your name for USERNAME, and of course your own serial number for PIDKEY.
Make sure you uncomment [Options], USERNAME, and PIDKEY else they won't get read
(you can leave USERNAME commented if you want, but you MUST have [Options]
uncommented for the PIDKEY value to be read).
