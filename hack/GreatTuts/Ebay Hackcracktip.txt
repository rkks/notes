Just found this on the net, so I gave it a try.

Lo and behold, it actually works.

Very handy if you are an Ebayer.
Enjoy

When you look at an item and click on bid history all the bid amount are replaced with "-" until the end of the auction.

To view these amounts before the auction ends when viewing the item change


http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll


in the address bar to


http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll


And then click on the bid history. The bid amounts will be shown.
