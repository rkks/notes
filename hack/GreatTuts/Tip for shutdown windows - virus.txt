 Try to open:

Run -> cmb -> shutdown -a

This prevent the shutdown.

 create a new shortcut.. then write;
shutdown -s -t 0 = this is for shut down in 0 seconds (t = time s=shutdown)
shutdown -r -t 0 = same but this is for restart comp. in 0 seconds..
(only for windows xp)
in win.98 this is different; we were wrote rundll32.exe -s or something like this..i couldnt remember right now..
