HOW TO CAPTURE STREAMING MEDIA

many websites (http://ww.smashits.com) stream songs and videos
people believe they cannot be downloaded, quite why i dont know. they kinda think there is no file present to dwnld

once the file is located it can then be retrieved by nettransport
nettransport is able to dwnld any file whether ftp or rtsp etc
