   1. Boot the computer using the XP CD. You may need to change the 
      boot order in the system BIOS. Check your system documentation 
      for steps to access the BIOS and change the boot order. 
    
    
  2. When you see the "Welcome To Setup" screen, you will see the 
     options below This portion of the Setup program prepares Microsoft 
     Windows XP to run on your computer:

   To setup Windows XP now, press ENTER.

   To repair a Windows XP installation using Recovery Console, press R.

   To quit Setup without installing Windows XP, press F3.
 
 
    
    
    3. Press Enter to start the Windows Setup. 

      do not choose "To repair a Windows XP installation using the 
      Recovery Console, press  R", (you do not want to load Recovery 
      Console). I repeat, do not choose "To repair a Windows XP 
      installation using the Recovery Console, press  R". 

    4. Accept the License Agreement and Windows will search for existing 
       Windows installations. 

    5. Select the XP installation you want to repair from the list and 
       press R to start the repair. If Repair is not one of the options, 
       read  this Warning!! 

    6. Setup will copy the necessary files to the hard drive and reboot.  
       Do not press any key to boot from CD when the message appears. 
       Setup will continue as if it were doing a clean install, but your 
       applications and settings will remain intact.
     
    Blaster worm warning: Do not immediately activate over the internet 
    when asked, enable the XP firewall
    [ http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=283673 ]
    before connecting to the internet. You can activate after the 
    firewall is enabled. Control Panel - Network Connections. Right click 
    the connection you use, Properties, and there is a check box on the 
    Advanced [ http://michaelstevenstech.com/xpfirewall1.jpg ] page.


    7. Reapply updates or service packs applied since initial Windows XP 
    installation. Please note that a Repair Install from the Original 
    install XP CD will remove SP1/SP2 and service packs will need to be 
    reapplied. 
    Service Pack 2

    4F30-8245-9E368D3CDB5A&displaylang=en 
    An option I highly recommend is creating a Slipstreamed XP CD with SP2.

    Warning!!
    If the option to Repair Install is not available and you continue 
    with the install;you will delete your Windows folder and Documents 
    and Settings folder. All applications that place keys in the registry 
    will need to be re-installed. You should exit setup if the repair 
    option is not available and consider other options.

    Warning!! If the Repair Option is not Available 
    What should I do? Most important do not ignore the information below!

    If the option to Repair Install is NOT available and you continue 
    with the install; you will delete your Windows folder, Documents and 
    Settings folders.  All Applications that place keys in the registry 
    will need to be re-installed. 

    You should exit setup if the repair option is not available and 
    consider other options. I have found if the Repair option is not 
    available, XP is usually not repairable and will require a Clean 
    install.http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html
    If you still have the ability to access the Windows XP installation, 
    backup all important files not restorable from other sources before 
    attempting any recovery console trouble shooting attempts. 
    
    Possible Fix by reconfiguring boot.ini using Recovery Console.
    1.Boot with XP CD or 6 floppy boot disk set.
    2. Press R to load the Recovery Console.  
    3. Type bootcfg.  
    4. This should fix any boot.ini errors causing setup not to see the  
       XP OS install.  
    5. Try the repair install.

    One more suggestion from MVP Alex Nichol

    "Reboot, this time taking the immediate R option, and if the CD 
     letter is say K: give these commands

    COPY K:\i386\ntldr C:\
    COPY K:\i386\ntdetect.com C:\


   (two other files needed - just in case) 

   1. Type: ATTRIB -H -R -S C:\boot.ini DEL C:\boot.ini 

   2. Type: BootCfg /Rebuild

   which will get rid of any damaged boot.ini, search the disk for 
   systems and make a new one. This might even result in a damaged 
   windows reappearing; but gives another chance of getting at the 
   repair"
 

   Feedback on success or failure of the above fixes would be greatly 
   appreciated.
