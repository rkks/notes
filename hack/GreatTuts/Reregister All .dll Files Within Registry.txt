I ran across this the other day on another site and I thought that a couple people might find it helpful, so here we go:


1) First go Start/Run, and type in 'cmd' to bring up the Command Prompt.

2) Type 'CD \' and hit enter.

3) Type 'DIR *.dll /s /b > regdll.bat' and hit enter.

4) Type 'Notepad regdll.bat' and hit enter.

Now Notepad is going to bring up a list of your .dll files, nevermind that for a moment.

---

5) Now type 'Path' and hit enter to see your current path. It will bring up something like: Path=c:\Windows;c:\windows\Command

6) (supplement your Windows Version, ex: C:\WINNT, or C:\Windows) Now type: 'Path=c:\windows;c:\windows\Command;c:\Windows\Prog
ram~\Accessories' and hit enter.

7) Verify again by typing 'Path' and hitting enter, and then type: 'C:\WINNT\System32\Regsvr32.exe /s C:\' and hit enter again.

8) Now, go back to Notepad and if you have Win98 use the replace feature in Wordpad (CTRL + H) or notepad to search for 'C:\' and replace it with this: 'C:\Windows\System\Regsvr32.exe /s C:\'

If you have Win2000, etc. use the replace command in note pad to search for 'C:\' and replace it with this: 'C:\WINNT\System32\Regsvr32.exe /s C:\'

*Be sure to type the replace string exactly like above or it won't work*

9) Use "Replace All" to make the changes to the entire file.

10) When it finishes, save it, exit notepad or wordpad, and return to the Command Prompt.

11) Type 'regdll' and press enter. If you followed the above steps correctly it will now go through and re-register all your .dll files.
