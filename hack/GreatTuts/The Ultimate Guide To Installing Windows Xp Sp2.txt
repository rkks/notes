First things first,

The warez keys that allow you to install XP SP2 are ones with the the PID (Product ID) of xxxxx-640-xxxxxxx-xxxxx

(Note: x's will be numbers)

the easiest way to check yours is by pressing the Windows Key + Break.

In the System Properties window that appears look down to the Registered to: section, if the second group of 3 numbers reads anything other than 640 you need this guide. If it reads 640 then you are safe.
